      "<b>with rigor [<i>befarekh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 1:13). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The word <i>befarekh</i> is a conjugation of the words: <b>With a soft mouth [<i>bifeh rakh</i>],</b> as the Egyptians enticed the Jewish people into slavery, gradually subjugating them until they had lost their freedom completely. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The word <i>befarekh</i> should be understood as: <b>With crushing [<i>bifrikha</i>],</b> as the Egyptians subjugated Israel with backbreaking labor.",
      "The next verse states: <b>“And they made their lives bitter through hard service, with mortar and brick,</b> and with every laborious service in the field” (Exodus 1:14). <b>Rava says:</b> The verse mentions specifically mortar and brick and then all forms of labor, as <b>initially</b> the Egyptians had them work <b>with mortar and bricks, and ultimately</b> they subjugated them <b>“and with every laborious service in the field.”</b>",
      "The verse concludes: <b>“In all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor”</b> (Exodus 1:14). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The meaning of <i>befarekh</i> is that the Egyptians <b>would exchange</b> the responsibilities of men and women, giving <b>men’s work to women and women’s work to men,</b> requiring everyone to do work to which they were unaccustomed. <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that <b>there,</b> in the previous verse, <i>bifarekh</i> indicates that the Egyptians enslaved the Jews <b>with a soft mouth, here,</b> in this verse, which describes the physical hardship of the labor, the word befarekh <b>certainly</b> means <b>with crushing</b> labor.",
      "§ <b>Rav Avira taught: In the merit of</b> the <b>righteous women that were in that generation, the Jewish people were redeemed from Egypt.</b> He tells of their righteous actions: <b>At the time</b> when these women <b>would go</b> to the river <b>to draw water, the Holy One, Blessed be He, would materialize for them small fish</b> that would enter <b>into their pitchers, and they would</b> therefore <b>draw</b> pitchers that were <b>half</b> filled with <b>water and half</b> filled with <b>fish. And they would</b> then <b>come and place two pots on the fire, one</b> pot <b>of hot</b> water for washing their husbands <b>and one</b> pot <b>of fish</b> with which to feed them.",
      "<b>And they would</b> then <b>take</b> what they prepared <b>to their husbands, to the field, and would bathe</b> their husbands <b>and anoint them</b> with oil <b>and feed them</b> the fish <b>and give them to drink and bond with them</b> in sexual intercourse <b>between the sheepfolds,</b> i.e., between the borders and fences of the fields, <b>as it is stated: “When you lie among the sheepfolds,</b> the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her pinions with the shimmer of gold” (Psalms 68:14), which is interpreted to mean that <b>as a reward</b> for “when you <b>lie among the sheepfolds,” the Jewish people merited to</b> receive <b>the plunder of Egypt, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse, as a reference to the Jewish people: <b>“The wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her pinions with the shimmer of gold”</b> (Psalms 68:14).",
      "<b>And when</b> these women would <b>become pregnant, they would come</b> back <b>to their homes, and when the time for them to give birth</b> would arrive <b>they would go and give birth in the field under the apple tree, as it is stated: “Under the apple tree I awakened you;</b> there your mother was in travail with you; there was she in travail and brought you forth” (Song of Songs 8:5).",
      "<b>And the Holy One, Blessed be He, would send from the heavens above</b> an angel <b>who would clean and prepare</b> the newborns, <b>just as a midwife prepares the newborn, as it is stated: “And as for your birth, on the day you were born, your navel was not cut nor were you washed with water for cleansing;</b> you were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all” (Ezekiel 16:4). This indicates that there were no midwives to take care of the Jews born in Egypt. <b>And</b> then, the angel <b>would gather for them two round</b> stones from the field and the babies would nurse from that which would flow out of them. <b>One of</b> the stones flowed with <b>oil and one of</b> the stones flowed with <b>honey, as it is stated: “And He would suckle them with honey from a crag and oil</b> from a flinty rock” (Deuteronomy 32:13).",
      "<b>And once the Egyptians would notice them,</b> realizing that they were Jewish babies, <b>they would come to kill them. But a miracle would occur for them and they would be absorbed by the earth. And</b> the Egyptians <b>would</b> then <b>bring oxen and would plow upon them, as it is stated: “The plowers plowed upon my back;</b> they made long their furrows” (Psalms 129:3). <b>After</b> the Egyptians <b>would leave,</b> the babies <b>would emerge and exit</b> the ground <b>like grass of the field, as it is stated: “I caused you to increase even as the growth of the field”</b> (Ezekiel 16:7).",
      "<b>And once</b> the babies <b>would grow, they would come like many flocks</b> of sheep <b>to their homes, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And you did increase and grow up and you came with excellent beauty [<i>ba’adi adayim</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 16:7). <b>Do not read</b> the verse as: <b>“<i>Ba’adi adayim</i>,”</b> “with excellent beauty.” <b>Rather,</b> read it as: <b><i>Be’edrei adarim</i>,</b> meaning: As many flocks.",
      "<b>And when the Holy One, Blessed be He, revealed Himself at the</b> Red <b>Sea,</b> these children <b>recognized Him first, as it is stated: “This is my God, and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). They recognized Him from the previous time that He revealed Himself to them in their infancy, enabling them to say: “This is my God.”",
      "§ The verse states: <b>“And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives,</b> of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah” (Exodus 1:15). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the proper interpretation of this verse. <b>One says</b> that these midwives were <b>a woman and her daughter, and one says</b> that they were <b>a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.</b> According to the <b>one who says</b> that they were <b>a woman and her daughter,</b> the women were <b>Jochebed,</b> the mother of Moses and Aaron, <b>and</b> her daughter, <b>Miriam. And</b> according to the <b>one who says</b> that they were <b>a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law,</b> the verse is referring to <b>Jochebed and</b> her daughter-in-law <b>Elisheba,</b> the wife of Aaron.",
      "It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>according to the one who says</b> that they were <b>a woman and her daughter, because it</b> is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>Shiphrah,</b> who is referred to in the verse, <b>this</b> is really a reference to <b>Jochebed. And why was she called Shiphrah? Because she would prepare [<i>mishapperet</i>] the newborn. Alternatively,</b> she is referred to as <b>Shiphrah because the Jewish people increased and multiplied [<i>shepparu verabbu</i>] in her days,</b> due to her assistance.",
      "The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>Puah,</b> who is referred to in the verse, <b>this</b> is really a reference to <b>Miriam. And why was she called Puah? Because she would make a comforting sound [<i>po’a</i>] as she would remove the child</b> from the womb of the mother. <b>Alternatively,</b> the word <b>Puah</b> is related to one of the verbs that describe speaking, <b>as she would speak [<i>po’a</i>] through divine inspiration and say: In the future, my mother will give birth to a son who will save the Jewish people.</b>",
      "The next verse relates the instructions of Pharaoh to the midwives: <b>“And he said: When you deliver the Hebrew women,</b> and you look upon the stones [<i>ovnayim</i>], if it be a son, then you shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live” (Exodus 1:16). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“stones”? Rabbi Ḥanan says:</b> Pharaoh <b>transmitted a great sign to them. He said to them: At the time</b> when a woman <b>crouches to give birth, her thighs become as cold as stones,</b> and, therefore, this shall be for you a sign that the woman is about to give birth.",
      "<b>And there are those who say</b> an alternative explanation for <i>ovnayim</i>: <b>As it is written: “So I went down to the potter’s shop, and behold, he was at his work on the wheels [<i>ovnayim</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 18:3). <b>Just as this potter</b> sits so that one <b>thigh</b> is <b>here and</b> one <b>thigh</b> is <b>there and the block</b> upon which he works <b>is in the middle, so too, a woman</b> giving birth also has one <b>thigh here and</b> one <b>thigh there and the newborn is in the middle.</b>",
      "The verse continues: <b>“If it be a son, then you shall kill him;</b> but if it be a daughter, then she shall live” (Exodus 1:16). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> Pharaoh <b>transmitted to them a great sign</b> to enable them to know the gender of the infant from the beginning of the birth process: <b>A boy</b> is born with <b>his face downward; a girl</b> is born with <b>her face upward.</b> Pharaoh provided them with this sign so that they could kill the boys secretly even before the mother realized what was happening.",
      "The next verse states: <b>“But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt spoke about them [<i>aleihen</i>],</b> but they kept the male children alive” (Exodus 1:17). The Gemara comments: <b>It should have</b> stated: “Spoke <b>to them [<i>lahen</i>].” Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Pharaoh <b>proposed to them to</b> engage in <b>a sinful act,</b> i.e., sexual intercourse, with him, <b>but they did not accept</b> his overtures. The word <i>aleihen</i> is often used in reference to sexual intercourse, for example: “And brought her to him; and he consorted with her [<i>eileha</i>]” (Genesis 29:23), and that is its connotation here as well.",
      "The verse concludes: <b>“But they kept the male children alive”</b> (Exodus 1:17). A Sage <b>teaches:</b> It is <b>not only that they did not kill</b> the children as Pharaoh had commanded them, <b>but that they would</b> even <b>provide for them water and food,</b> as the phrase “But they kept the male children alive” indicates.",
      "After being questioned by Pharaoh concerning their failure to obey his command, the midwives responded, as it is written: <b>“And the midwives said to Pharaoh: Because</b> the Hebrew women <b>are not as the</b> Egyptian <b>women,</b> for they are lively [<i>ḥayot</i>], and are delivered before the midwife comes to them” (Exodus 1:19). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“<i>ḥayot</i>”? If we say</b> that the Hebrew women are like <i>ḥayot</i>, meaning <b>actual midwives</b> for themselves, and therefore they do not need assistance from others, <b>is that to say</b> that <b>a midwife does not need</b> the assistance of <b>another midwife</b> in order <b>to help her give birth?</b>",
      "<b>Rather,</b> the midwives <b>said to</b> Pharaoh: <b>This nation is compared to an animal [<i>ḥayya</i>],</b> and animals give birth without a midwife. For example, with regard to <b>Judah</b> it is written: “Judah is <b>a lion’s whelp”</b> (Genesis 49:9); with regard to <b>Dan</b> it is written: <b>“Dan shall be a serpent</b> in the way” (Genesis 49:17); with regard to <b>Naphtali</b> it is written: <b>“A hind let loose”</b> (Genesis 49:21); with regard to <b>Issachar</b> it is written: <b>“A large-boned donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14); with regard to <b>Joseph</b> it is written: “His <b>first bullock”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17); with regard to <b>Benjamin</b> it is written: <b>“A ravenous wolf”</b> (Genesis 49:27).",
      "The Gemara comments: Concerning those individuals <b>where</b> a comparison to an animal <b>is written with regard to him,</b> it <b>is</b> already <b>written with regard to him. And</b> concerning those <b>where no</b> specific metaphor comparing them to an animal is <b>written with regard to him</b> explicitly, in any case a general comparison <b>is written about</b> the Jewish people: <b>“How your mother was a lioness; among lions she crouched,</b> in the midst of the young lions she reared her whelps” (Ezekiel 19:2), indicating that all the Jewish people are compared to animals.",
      "The verse relates the midwives’ reward: <b>“And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses”</b> (Exodus 1:21). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the precise interpretation of these houses: <b>One says</b> that God made <b>the houses of</b> the <b>priesthood and</b> the <b>Levites</b> descend from the midwives, <b>and one says</b> that God made the <b>houses of royalty</b> descend from them. <b>The one who says</b> that it is referring to the <b>houses of</b> the <b>priesthood and</b> the <b>Levites</b> is referring to <b>Aaron and Moses,</b> who were sons of Jochebed. <b>And the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>houses of royalty</b> is referring to <b>David,</b> who <b>also comes from Miriam, as it is written: “And Azubah,” the wife of Caleb, “died, and Caleb took to him Ephrath, who bore him Hur”</b> (I Chronicles 2:19) and, as will be explained further, Ephrath is Miriam. <b>And it is written: “David was the son of that Ephrathite</b> of Bethlehem in Judah” (I Samuel 17:12). Therefore, he was a descendant of Miriam.",
      "The Gemara discusses the family of Caleb: In Chronicles it says: <b>“And Caleb, the son of Hezron, begot children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth, and these were her sons: Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon”</b> (I Chronicles 2:18). The Gemara asks: Was Caleb actually the <b>son of Hezron? Wasn’t he</b> the <b>son of Jephunneh,</b> as the verse states in Numbers 13:6? The Gemara answers: He was the son of Hezron, but he is called “son of Jephunneh” as an appellation indicating that he was <b>a son who turned away [<i>sheppana</i>] from the counsel of the spies.</b>",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> it is <b>still</b> difficult. Hezron could not be his father, as Caleb <b>was</b> the <b>son of Kenaz, as it is written: “And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s</b> younger <b>brother, took it”</b> (Judges 1:13). This would mean that Caleb was also a son of Kenaz. <b>Rava said:</b> Caleb <b>was the stepson of Kenaz,</b> as he and Othniel shared a mother but had different fathers."

        "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who issues a warning to his wife</b> not to seclude herself with a particular man, so that if she does not heed his warning she will assume the status of a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>], <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He <b>issues a warning to her based on,</b> i.e., in the presence of, <b>two</b> witnesses for the warning to be effective. If two witnesses were not present for the warning, she is not a <i>sota</i> even if two witnesses saw her seclusion with another man. <b>And</b> the husband <b>gives</b> the bitter water to her <b>to drink based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness</b> who saw the seclusion, <b>or</b> even <b>based on his own</b> testimony that he himself saw them secluded together, as Rabbi Eliezer holds that only the warning requires witnesses, not the seclusion. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> He both <b>issues a warning to her based on two</b> witnesses <b>and gives</b> the bitter water to her <b>to drink based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses.",
        "The mishna asks: <b>How</b> does he <b>issue a warning to her</b> in an effective manner? If he <b>says to her in the presence of two</b> witnesses: <b>Do not speak with</b> the <b>man</b> called <b>so-and-so, and she</b> nevertheless <b>spoke with him, she is still permitted to her home,</b> i.e., she is permitted to engage in sexual intercourse with her husband, <b>and</b> if she is the wife of a priest <b>she is</b> still <b>permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b>",
        "However, if after he told her not to speak with so-and-so, <b>she entered into a secluded place and remained with</b> that man long <b>enough to</b> become <b>defiled,</b> i.e., sufficient time to engage in sexual intercourse, <b>she is forbidden to her home</b> from that moment until she undergoes the <i>sota</i> rite. <b>And</b> likewise, if she was the wife of a priest <b>she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as she was possibly disqualified by her infidelity, so long as her innocence is not proven by means of the bitter water. <b>And if</b> her husband <b>dies</b> childless before she drinks the bitter water, <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with her late husband’s brother <b>and may not enter into levirate marriage,</b> as, if she had been unfaithful, levirate marriage is forbidden.",
        "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the placement of this tractate within the mishnaic order of <i>Nashim</i>. <b>Now,</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> arose from</b> tractate <b><i>Nazir</i>,</b> which is the tractate preceding <i>Sota</i> in the order of the Mishna. <b>What</b> did he <b>teach</b> in <i>Nazir</i> <b>that</b> required that he <b>teach</b> tractate <b><i>Sota</i></b> immediately afterward, as at first glance there seems to be no connection between this tractate and <i>Nazir</i>?",
        "The Gemara answers: This was done <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with regard to the sequence of passages in the Torah, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Why is the portion of a nazirite</b> (Numbers, chapter 6) <b>placed adjacent to the portion of a <i>sota</i></b> (Numbers, chapter 5)? This was done <b>to tell you that anyone who sees a <i>sota</i> in her disgrace</b> as she undergoes the rite of the bitter water <b>should renounce wine,</b> as wine is one of the causes of sexual transgression, as it loosens inhibitions. For the same reason that the Torah teaches these passages one after the other, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi arranged these tractates one after the other.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> him <b>teach</b> tractate <b><i>Sota</i> first and then let</b> him <b>teach</b> tractate <b><i>Nazir</i>,</b> which is the way these topics are ordered in the Torah, and also accords better with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> tractate <b><i>Ketubot</i>, and</b> in that tractate he <b>taught</b> a chapter that begins: <b>One who vows,</b> in which there are several <i>mishnayot</i> concerning vows between husbands and wives, he then <b>taught</b> tractate <b><i>Nedarim</i>,</b> whose subject is the <i>halakhot</i> of vows. <b>And since</b> he <b>taught</b> tractate <b><i>Nedarim</i>,</b> he then <b>taught</b> tractate <b><i>Nazir</i>, which is similar to</b> tractate <b><i>Nedarim</i></b> in that one becomes a nazirite by taking a vow. <b>And</b> he then <b>teaches</b> tractate <b><i>Sota</i>, in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
        "§ The Gemara begins clarifying the mishna. The mishna states: <b>One who issues a warning</b> to his wife. By employing the descriptive phrase: One who issues a warning, and not the prescriptive phrase: One issues a warning, the <i>tanna</i> indicates that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> it is effective if he issues a warning in this manner, but ideally, <b>no,</b> one should not issue a warning to his wife at all <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Apparently, <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>holds</b> that it <b>is prohibited to issue a warning</b> to one’s wife <i>ab initio</i> in a manner that can cause her to become a <i>sota</i>, and all the <i>halakhot</i> concerning a <i>sota</i> are for one who issued a warning when not obligated to do so.",
        "<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: When Reish Lakish would introduce</b> his discussion of the Torah passage <b>of <i>sota</i></b> he would <b>say this:</b> Heaven <b>matches a woman to a man only according to his actions, as it is stated: “For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous”</b> (Psalms 125:3), indicating that if one has a wicked wife it is due to his own evil conduct. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And it is as difficult to match</b> a couple together <b>as</b> was <b>the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated</b> in a verse that speaks of the exodus from Egypt: <b>“God makes the solitary individuals dwell in a house; He brings out prisoners into prosperity [<i>bakosharot</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:7). God takes single individuals and causes them to dwell in a house by properly matching a man to a woman. This is similar to the exodus from Egypt, which culminated in the splitting of the Red Sea, where He released prisoners into prosperity.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so</b> that a man is matched to a woman according to his actions? <b>But Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Forty days before an embryo is formed a Divine Voice issues forth and says: The daughter of so-and-so is</b> destined <b>to</b> marry <b>so-and-so; such and such a house is</b> destined <b>to</b> be inhabited by <b>so-and-so; such and such a field is</b> destined <b>to</b> be farmed by <b>so-and-so.</b> This clearly states that these matters, including marriage, are decreed for a person even before he is formed. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement that Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rav is <b>with regard to a first match [<i>zivug</i>],</b> while <b>this</b> statement of Rabba bar bar Ḥana in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan is <b>with regard to a second match.</b> A first match is decreed in heaven; a second match is according to one’s actions.",
        "§ The Gemara now clarifies the dispute in the mishna. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The husband must <b>issue a warning to her based on,</b> i.e., in the presence of, <b>two</b> witnesses, and he gives the bitter water to her to drink based on the testimony of one witness. Rabbi Yehoshua says: He both issues a warning to her based on two witnesses and gives the bitter water to her to drink based on the testimony of two witnesses who saw them secluded together. The Gemara notes: Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>disagree only with regard to</b> the requisite number of witnesses for the <b>warning and</b> the <b>seclusion,</b> whether one or two witnesses are required, <b>but with regard to</b> the testimony concerning <b>defilement</b> after the warning was issued and seclusion had occurred, they agree that even the testimony of <b>one witness is deemed credible</b> to establish that the woman actually engaged in sexual intercourse with the man while secluded.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>And we learned also</b> in another mishna (31a) that if <b>a single witness says: I saw that she was defiled,</b> then <b>she would not drink</b> the bitter water, as the testimony is accepted, and her husband must divorce her and she forfeits payment of her marriage contract. Therefore, there is no need to perform the <i>sota</i> rite.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>By Torah law, from where do we</b> derive <b>that one witness is deemed credible</b> with regard to testifying that a <i>sota</i> engaged in sexual intercourse? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in reference to the verse describing the circumstances in which a woman defiled through an act of adultery becomes forbidden to her husband, which states: “And a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, she being defiled secretly, <b>and there is no witness [<i>ed</i>] against her”</b> (Numbers 5:13), <b>the verse is speaking of</b> a lack of <b>two</b> witnesses. When the verse refers to the lack of an <i>ed</i>, written in the singular, it actually indicates that there are not two witnesses against her, but only one, as the <i>baraita</i> will now explain.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues and asks: <b>Or</b> perhaps the verse is referring <b>only</b> to a case where there was not <b>even one</b> witness to the act of sexual intercourse, as the singular usage of the word <i>ed</i> would seem to indicate? The <i>baraita</i> now proves that elsewhere the word <i>ed</i> is used to indicate two witnesses, as <b>the verse states: “One witness [<i>ed</i>] shall not rise up against a man</b> for any iniquity or any sin that he sins; by the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15)."
      ],
      [
        "The <i>baraita</i> infers a general principle from this verse by asking: <b>By inference from that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse, even with the omission of the word “one”: <b>“A witness shall not rise up against a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), <b>do I not know that it is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness, as the term “rise up [<i>yakum</i>]” is written in the singular form? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> explicitly: <b>“One</b> witness,” since it is obviously referring to only one witness? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>This established a paradigm</b> that <b>every place</b> where the word <b>“witness [<i>ed</i>]” is stated</b> in the Torah without specifying a number, <b>there are two</b> witnesses <b>here, unless the verse specifies</b> that it is referring to only one witness by writing the word <b>“one.”</b>",
        "The <i>baraita</i> returns to discuss the verse concerning a <i>sota</i>. <b>And the Merciful One states:</b> “There is no witness [<i>ed</i>] against her” (Numbers 5:13), which therefore means that <b>there are not two</b> witnesses to the sexual intercourse that could testify <b>with regard to her; rather,</b> there is only <b>one</b> witness. The <i>baraita</i> completes its interpretation: Further in the verse it states: <b>“And she was not taken,”</b> indicating that the verse is referring to a case in which it is known that the woman had not been raped. This knowledge is based on the testimony of only one witness, as the verse had already stated that there were not two witnesses, and since one witness saw her willingly engage in sexual intercourse with another man, <b>she is forbidden.</b>",
        "The Gemara questions this reasoning: <b>But</b> this would seem to indicate that <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> to interpret the verse concerning a <i>sota</i> as referring to a case where there is only one witness is <b>that it is written</b> in the other verse: <b>“One witness shall not rise up against a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), indicating that any unspecified usage of the word <i>ed</i> in the Torah refers to two witnesses, <b>but</b> were it <b>not</b> for <b>this</b> inference, <b>I would say</b> that when the term <b>witness</b> is employed in the verse <b>concerning a <i>sota</i></b> it <b>is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness. However, this would mean that the woman is forbidden to her husband even if there is not even one witness who saw the alleged sexual intercourse, <b>and if there is not even one</b> witness to testify, <b>then with what</b> testimony <b>does she become forbidden</b> to her husband? Obviously, even without another verse, it must be understood that the verse is indicating that there are not two witnesses but there is one, or else there would be no testimony to her actions.",
        "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to infer the interpretation of the verse concerning the <i>sota</i> from the other verse mentioning one witness. Otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the verse here that states: <b>“There is no witness against her,”</b> means that a single witness testifying about the sexual intercourse <b>is not deemed credible with regard to her</b> under any circumstances, and the testimony of one witness is not accepted in the case of a <i>sota</i>.",
        "The Gemara questions this analysis: What would be the logic in interpreting the verse as indicating that a single witness <b>is not deemed credible with regard to her? But</b> if that is the interpretation, <b>what</b> does the verse <b>require</b> in order for a <i>sota</i> to be rendered forbidden?",
        "The Gemara explains its question: If the verse is understood as indicating that a woman isn’t forbidden <b>until there are two witnesses</b> to testify to her infidelity, then <b>let the verse be silent from</b> any mention of witnesses, <b>as</b> the requirement for two witnesses in matters of sexual impropriety <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“matter”</b> written with regard to forbidden relations, and the word <b>“matter”</b> written with regard to <b>monetary matters.</b> The verbal analogy by which it is learned that two witnesses are required is as follows: A verse concerning forbidden relations states: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), and a verse concerning monetary matters states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>And I</b> would <b>know</b> that the requirement that two witnesses testify applies in the case of a <i>sota</i>, <b>just as it does in all</b> other matters of <b>testimony in the Torah.</b>",
        "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> that the verse be stated in the case of a <i>sota</i> as well, for it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that testimony concerning <b>a <i>sota</i> is different</b> from other testimony, and even testimony of one witness would be sufficient <b>because</b> there is <b>a basis for</b> anticipating <b>the matter. Since</b> the husband <b>issued a warning to her</b> about this particular man <b>and she</b> then <b>secluded</b> herself with him, perhaps even <b>one witness should be deemed credible with regard to her.</b> Therefore, the verse informs us that one witness is not deemed credible to render her forbidden to her husband.",
        "The Gemara asks another question concerning its earlier analysis: <b>But how can you</b> think to <b>say</b> that the verse would be stating that one witness <b>is not deemed credible with regard to her</b> having engaged in sexual intercourse <b>and she</b> would remain <b>permitted</b> to her husband? <b>But from</b> the continuation of the same verse, from the fact <b>that it is written: “And she was not taken,”</b> which indicates that the verse is referring to a case where she was not raped, one concludes <b>by inference</b> that the verse is referring to a woman <b>who</b> becomes <b>forbidden</b> to her husband for engaging in consensual adulterous sexual intercourse.",
        "The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, it still <b>was necessary</b> to teach the principle derived from the other verse that the term “<i>ed</i>” is referring to two witnesses even in the context of a <i>sota</i>, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the verse should be understood to mean that one witness <b>is not deemed credible with regard to her,</b> and she remains permitted <b>until there are two</b> witnesses who testify to the sexual intercourse, <b>and with</b> the testimony of <b>two witnesses as well, it is</b> only <b>when she was not seized</b> and forced to cohabit with the man. Therefore, to refute this possible interpretation, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that “<i>ed</i>” always refers to two witnesses unless stated otherwise. Therefore, the phrase in the verse concerning a <i>sota</i> that says: “There is no witness [<i>ed</i>] against her,” means that there were not two witnesses, but if there was only one witness he is deemed credible.",
        "The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> He both <b>issues a warning to her based on two</b> witnesses, and he gives the bitter water to her to drink based on the testimony of two witnesses who saw her secluded. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>verse states:</b> “And there is no witness [<i>ed</i>] <b>against her [<i>bah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:13), which was explained to mean there were not two witnesses, but only one, who testified concerning her defilement. Rabbi Yehoshua derives from the term <i>bah</i>, which could also be understood as: <b>With regard to it,</b> that in this matter of defilement one witness suffices, <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> Additionally, he derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b> Therefore, there must be two witnesses to testify about both the warning and the seclusion.",
        "The Gemara now explains Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that the only derivation to be learned is: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> Therefore, the warning, unlike the defilement, requires two witnesses. The seclusion is not contrasted with the defilement, and, like the defilement, requires only one.",
        "The Gemara questions Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that one should also derive: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion,</b> as does Rabbi Yehoshua? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer does not accept that derivation, as <b>seclusion is juxtaposed to defilement</b> by the verse, <b>as it is written: “And she was defiled secretly”</b> (Numbers 5:13), and the term “secretly” is referring to seclusion. Therefore, the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to both.",
        "The Gemara asks: But the <b>warning is also juxtaposed to defilement, as it is written: “And he warned his wife, and she had become defiled”</b> (Numbers 5:14) and the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to both. The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excluded</b> at least one of the two by use of the expression <b><i>bah</i>,</b> which teaches that in one matter other than defilement, two witnesses are required.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> to determine that the exclusion from the <i>halakha</i> of one witness sufficing is with regard to the warning? Perhaps the exclusion from the <i>halakha</i> of one witness sufficing is with regard to the seclusion. The Gemara answers: It <b>stands to reason</b> that it is <b>preferable</b> to compare <b>seclusion</b> to defilement, <b>as</b> testimony with regard to seclusion <b>forbids her</b> to her husband <b>just as</b> testimony with regard to <b>defilement</b> does.",
        "The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>On the contrary,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to compare the <b>warning</b> to the defilement, <b>as</b> it is the <b>main cause</b> of <b>her</b> becoming forbidden. Seclusion alone, absent a warning, would not cause her to be forbidden to her husband.",
        "The Gemara counters: <b>If</b> there is <b>no seclusion, is there</b> any significance to the <b>warning?</b> The warning results in a prohibition only after the warned woman secludes herself with the man. The Gemara counters: <b>And if</b> there is <b>no warning, what effectiveness does seclusion have?</b> Both the warning and the seclusion are required for her to be forbidden.",
        "The Gemara concludes: <b>Even so,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to compare the <b>seclusion</b> to the defilement, <b>as</b> the seclusion <b>is the beginning of defilement.</b> Therefore, just as the testimony of one witness suffices with regard to the defilement, the testimony of one witness suffices with regard to the seclusion.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who presents a different version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1) that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: One who issues a warning to his wife issues a warning based on one witness or based on his own</b> testimony, <b>and</b> he <b>gives</b> the bitter water to her <b>to drink based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses who saw her secluded. The <i>baraita</i> further states that <b>the Rabbis responded: According to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that one need not issue a warning in the presence of two witnesses, <b>there is no end to the matter,</b> as the Gemara will explain.",
        "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “<i>Bah</i>,”</b> from which he infers that one witness suffices to testify <b>with regard to it,</b> i.e., the defilement, <b>but not with regard to seclusion,</b> as above.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that one should also derive: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>warning is juxtaposed to defilement, as it is written: “And he warned his wife, and she had become defiled”</b> (Numbers 5:14), and the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to both.",
        "The Gemara counters this argument: <b>Seclusion is also juxtaposed</b> in the verse <b>to defilement, as it is written: “And she was defiled secretly”</b> (Numbers 5:13). Therefore, the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to both. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> verse <b>is coming to</b> teach <b>how much</b> is the <b>measure of seclusion,</b> i.e., the amount of time that the man and woman must be secluded together for it to be defined as seclusion, which, as the comparison indicates, is the amount of time <b>sufficient for defilement.</b>",
        "The Gemara continues to clarify the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Rabbis responded: According to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>there is no end to the matter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: There is no end to the matter? The Gemara answers: It is <b>that</b> there may be <b>times when</b> the husband <b>did not warn</b> his wife <b>but</b> after hearing of her seclusion with another man <b>says: I warned her,</b> which will be sufficient to render her forbidden to him until she drinks.",
        "The Gemara is puzzled by this logic: <b>But according to our mishna, does the matter</b> in fact <b>have an end?</b> Rabbi Eliezer states in the mishna that a woman must drink the bitter water based upon her husband’s own statement that she secluded herself with the man about whom he had warned her. There too, one could ask whether there may be <b>times when she did not seclude herself</b> with the other man <b>and</b> where <b>her husband says: She secluded herself,</b> thereby rendering her forbidden to him until she drinks the bitter water. If so, why do the Rabbis take issue only with the version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion as presented by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and not with the version recorded in the mishna?",
        "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Rabbis in the <i>baraita</i> meant to state that <b>even according to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, there is no end to the matter.</b> The Rabbis wished to say that even according to his version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, the husband can cause her to drink if he were to lie. The same is obviously true for the mishna.",
        "The Gemara notes: The phrase <b>even according to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> indicates it is a lesser novelty to say that there is no end to the matter according to him, <b>and it is not necessary</b> to say that the same would be true <b>according to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer cited in <b>our mishna.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, according to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer cited in <b>our mishna,</b> there <b>is</b> a legitimate <b>basis</b> of suspicion with regard to the woman, as there are witnesses who saw the husband issue a warning to her, and therefore, it is understandable that the testimony of the husband may be relied upon when he testifies that she secluded herself with another man. By contrast, <b>there,</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>there is no</b> legitimate <b>basis</b> to prohibit her to him, since there are no witnesses that she had been warned by her husband at all. Therefore, it may be that the Rabbis took issue only with the version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion presented by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.",
        "The Gemara clarifies the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated like this: Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the Rabbis said: <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who is not concerned that accepting the testimony of one person with regard to the warning will enable false claims by the husband, <b>even according to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer cited in <b>our mishna there is no end to the matter,</b> since the concern there is less severe, as there is no legitimate basis to render her forbidden to her husband.",
        "<b>Rav Ḥanina of Sura says: In the present a man should not say to his wife: Do not seclude yourself with so-and-so.</b> The reason is that <b>perhaps we maintain</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a warning</b> is effective even <b>based on his own</b> testimony, <b>and</b> if she were then to <b>seclude herself</b> with that man she would be required to drink the bitter water to render herself permitted to her husband, <b>and</b> since <b>today</b> the bitter <b>water of a <i>sota</i></b> is <b>not</b> used <b>to evaluate her</b> fidelity and permit her to her husband, <b>he will</b> end up <b>forbidding her to himself</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition.</b>",
        "§ <b>Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of the <b>term: Warning [<i>kinnui</i>]?</b> It means <b>a matter that causes anger [<i>kina</i>] between her and others,</b> as other men will not understand why she does not wish to be friendly with them any longer. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently, he holds</b> that <b>a warning</b> is effective <b>based on</b> the husband’s <b>own</b> testimony, <b>and</b> therefore <b>everyone else will not know that her husband issued a warning to her, and they will say: What is this</b> matter happening <b>before us that she separates herself</b> from us, <b>and they will come to act in anger with her.</b>",
        "<b>And Rav Yeimar bar Rabbi Shelemya says in the name of Abaye:</b> The term <i>kinnui</i> means <b>a matter that causes anger between him and her,</b> i.e., between husband and wife. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently, he holds</b> that <b>a warning</b> is effective <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two witnesses.</b> And since there are two witnesses, <b>everyone knows that he issued a warning to her.</b> Therefore, the warning does not cause anger between her and others. <b>And the husband is he who will come to act in anger with her,</b> as they will have mutual antagonism toward each other."

      "<b>Apparently,</b> both Reish Lakish and Rav Yeimar bar Rabbi Shelemya <b>hold that</b> it is <b>prohibited to issue a warning.</b> Both are of the opinion that the word <i>kinnui</i> is a term for anger. Since causing anger is a negative trait, it follows that it is prohibited to issue a warning.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who says</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> for him <b>to issue a warning, what is</b> the meaning of the <b>term <i>kinnui</i>? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> The term <b><i>kinnui</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a term of forewarning, and so it says: “Then the Lord warned [<i>vayekanneh</i>] concerning His land</b> and had pity for His people” (Joel 2:18). As detailed in that passage, the Lord ordered the locusts to stop destroying Eretz Yisrael.",
      "It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A person commits a transgression in private and the Holy One, Blessed be He, proclaims about him openly,</b> i.e., in public, that he transgressed, <b>as it is stated</b> concerning a <i>sota</i>, who transgressed in private: <b>“The spirit of jealousy came [<i>avar</i>] upon him”</b> (Numbers 5:14); <b>and</b> the term <b><i>avira</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a term of proclamation, as it is stated: “And Moses gave the commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed [<i>vaya’aviru</i>] throughout the camp”</b> (Exodus 36:6).",
      "<b>Reish Lakish says: A man commits a transgression only if a spirit of folly [<i>shetut</i>] enters him, as it is stated: “If any man’s wife goes aside [<i>tisteh</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:12). The word <i>tisteh</i> is <b>written</b> with the Hebrew letter <i>shin</i>, affording an alternative reading of <b><i>tishteh</i>,</b> which is related to the term for folly, the word <i>shetut</i>.",
      "§ The Gemara discusses why the testimony of one witness suffices with regard to defilement. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah deem credible a single witness with regard to</b> the defilement of <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b> It is <b>because there is a basis for</b> anticipating <b>the matter,</b> as there is strong circumstantial evidence that she committed adultery. What is the basis for anticipating the matter? <b>As he warned her</b> not to seclude herself with a specific man, <b>and she</b> nevertheless <b>secluded herself</b> with him, <b>and one witness testifies that she is defiled,</b> then the combination of her behavior and the testimony renders it reasonable to assume that she has in fact committed adultery.",
      "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But when the warning is written</b> in the Torah, <b>it is written</b> in the verse <b>after seclusion and defilement</b> are mentioned, indicating that the circumstance in which one witness is deemed credible with regard to defilement is even when there was no previous warning. The order in which the Torah describes the <i>sota</i> process seems to indicate that the husband’s warning is issued only after the wife already secluded herself with the other man and was defiled, as the verses state: “And a man lie with her carnally, and it was hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she was defiled secretly, and there is no witness against her, and she was not taken. And the spirit of jealousy came [<i>ve’avar</i>] upon him, and he warned his wife, and she had become defiled” (Numbers 5:13–14).",
      "Abaye <b>said to him</b> in response: That which the verse states: <b>“And</b> the spirit of jealousy <b>came [<i>ve’avar</i>]</b> upon him,” means: <b>And</b> it had <b>already come</b> upon him, that the husband warned his wife not to seclude herself with a specific man prior to her seclusion and defilement.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that “<i>ve’avar</i>” is referring to a matter that already occurred, then in the case of the agreement between Moses and the tribes of Gad and Reuben before they entered Eretz Yisrael, where he stated: <b>“And every armed man of you will pass over [<i>ve’avar</i>]</b> the Jordan” (Numbers 32:21), <b>so too</b> did he mean that they had already crossed? Moses was stipulating a condition with regard to the future; they had yet to cross the Jordan.",
      "The Gemara answers: <b>There, from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “And the land be subdued before the Lord, and you return afterward”</b> (Numbers 32:22), it is clear that it <b>teaches concerning the future. But here, if it enters your mind</b> that the verses should be understood <b>as they are written</b> in the Torah, that <b>“<i>ve’avar</i>”</b> (Numbers 5:14) is <b>after</b> the <b>defilement and seclusion,</b> then <b>why do I</b> need <b>a warning?</b> If the woman had already secluded herself with the man and become defiled, the husband’s warning would be irrelevant, as she had already become forbidden to him. Therefore, the word <i>ve’avar</i> in this context must be referring to a past event, i.e., the husband issuing a warning to his wife prior to the seclusion.",
      "<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: A man issues a warning to his wife only if a spirit entered him, as it is stated: “And the spirit of jealousy came upon him, and he warned his wife”</b> (Numbers 5:14). The Gemara asks: Of <b>what spirit</b> does Rabbi Yishmael speak?",
      "<b>The Rabbis say: A spirit of impurity,</b> as one should not issue a warning to one’s wife. <b>Rav Ashi says: A spirit of purity,</b> as issuing a warning indicates that he will not tolerate promiscuous behavior.",
      "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it <b>stands to reason like the one who says</b> that Rabbi Yishmael was speaking of <b>a spirit of purity, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he warned his wife,”</b> i.e., the issuing of the warning, is <b>optional,</b> that the husband is neither enjoined to nor prohibited from issuing a warning; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory,</b> as one who sees his wife behaving in an inappropriate manner with another man is obligated to warn her. The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Rabbi Yishmael was speaking of <b>a spirit of purity,</b> then it is <b>well,</b> as it may be optional, or even mandatory, to issue a warning. <b>But if you say</b> that he was speaking of <b>a spirit of impurity,</b> can it be <b>optional or mandatory for a person to introduce a spirit of impurity into himself?</b> The Torah would not require a husband to act in a manner that results from having a spirit of impurity enter him.",
      "§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. “And he warned his wife,”</b> i.e., the warning, is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. And Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory.</b> The Gemara notes that Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva engage in a similar dispute with regard to several other verses. Although under normal circumstances it is prohibited for a priest to become ritually impure through contact with a corpse, the verse states that he may do so for the sake of burying his relatives. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>“For her may he become impure”</b> (Leviticus 21:3), i.e., for a priest to participate in the burial of his sister, despite the fact that he will contract ritual impurity, is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> A priest is not obligated to participate, but he may. <b>And Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory</b> for him to do so.",
      "The verse states: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), i.e., keeping one’s Canaanite slave forever, is <b>optional, this is the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> One is not enjoined against emancipating a Canaanite slave, but one is permitted to keep his Canaanite slaves forever. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory,</b> and it is prohibited for one to free his Canaanite slave.",
      "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Mesharshiyya</b> said <b>to Rava: Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva disagree</b> in <b>this</b> manner <b>with regard to the entire Torah?</b> In other words, is it so that whenever there is a statement where it is unclear whether it is referring to an optional or mandatory act, <b>that</b> one <b>master,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, <b>says</b> that it is <b>optional, and</b> the other <b>master,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>says</b> that it is <b>mandatory.</b> Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa in response: <b>Here,</b> in these particular cases, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the meaning of these specific <b>verses,</b> but it is not a general dispute.",
      "The Gemara explains their dispute in these specific contexts, beginning with the dispute concerning a man’s warning to his wife: <b>“And he warned his wife,”</b> the warning is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory.</b>",
      "<b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> He <b>holds in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: With regard to</b> that <b>which the Torah said: “You shall not hate your brother in your heart”</b> (Leviticus 19:17), one <b>might</b> have thought that this prohibition applies in a case <b>such as this</b> one, when one sees his wife behaving improperly with another man, and the verse would instruct the husband to avoid conflict and strife. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the spirit of jealousy came upon him, and he warned his wife”</b> (Numbers 5:14), teaching that it is permitted for one to issue a warning to his wife in such a case.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive that it is mandatory? The Gemara answers: There <b>is another warning written</b> in the same verse, as the entire verse reads: “And the spirit of jealousy came upon him, and he warned his wife, and she be defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy came upon him, and he warned his wife, and she be not defiled.” Therefore, the first half of the verse teaches that it is permitted to issue a warning, and the second half teaches that it is in fact mandatory.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> explain the repetition? The Gemara answers: <b>Since it needed to write</b> in this verse both possibilities as to whether the woman was unfaithful: <b>“And she be defiled,”</b> and also: <b>“And she be not defiled,”</b> to teach that although it is uncertain whether she had become defiled, she is still forbidden to her husband, therefore, <b>it is also written: “And he warned his wife,”</b> a second time. This repetition should not be interpreted as rendering the issuance of the warning as mandatory.",
      "This manner of interpreting verses is <b>as taught by the school of Rabbi Yishmael, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Every passage</b> in the Torah <b>that was stated and repeated was repeated only for the novel element introduced therein.</b> Although the Torah could have merely mentioned the element necessary to teach an additional <i>halakha</i>, one should not interpret the repetition of a previously mentioned matter as teaching a second additional <i>halakha</i>, as the style of the Torah is to repeat a passage even to teach only one additional <i>halakha</i>. In the case of the passage concerning a <i>sota</i> as well, the repetition of the warning does not teach a new <i>halakha</i>.",
      "The Gemara discusses the second dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: “And for his sister a virgin, that is near to him, that has had no husband, <b>for her may he become impure”</b> (Leviticus 21:3), i.e., for a priest to participate in the burial of his sister despite the fact that he will contract ritual impurity is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> A priest is not obligated to participate, but he may do so. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory</b> for him to do so.",
      "<b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael? Since it is written: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: There shall none become impure for the dead among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:1), indicating that a priest is enjoined from contact with the dead, it <b>was necessary to be written: “For her may he become impure,”</b> which teaches that a priest may become impure at the burial of a relative.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive that it is mandatory? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> that it is permissible <b>from</b> the previous verse, which states: <b>“Except for his kin,</b> that is near to him” (Leviticus 21:2). Since it is derived that it is permitted from that verse, <b>why do I</b> need the additional verse: <b>“For her may he become impure”? To</b> teach that it is <b>mandatory.</b>",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> explain the repetition? The Gemara answers: He explains that the verse teaches that <b>he may become impure for her, but he may not become impure to</b> bury only one of <b>her limbs.</b> This additional verse teaches that a priest may become ritually impure to bury a relative only in the case of burying a complete body."

      "<b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse serves to render it prohibited for a priest to become impure to bury a limb, then <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> “And for his sister a virgin, that is near to him, that has had no husband, <b>for her,” and</b> then <b>be silent. Why do I</b> need the verse to write: <b>“May he become impure”? Learn from</b> the additional phrase that making himself impure is mandatory.",
      "<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> explain the additional phrase? <b>Since</b> the verse <b>wrote: “For her,”</b> it <b>also wrote: “May he become impure,” for</b> the same reason <b>as was taught by the school of Rabbi Yishmael. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Every passage</b> in the Torah <b>that was stated and repeated, was repeated only for the novel element introduced therein.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the verse serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that a priest may not become impure in order to bury a limb, and that would account for the repetition of the phrase “may he become impure” as well.",
      "The Gemara discusses the third dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The verse states: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), i.e., the <i>halakha</i> that one keeps his Canaanite slave forever, is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> One is not enjoined against emancipating a Canaanite slave, but one is permitted to keep a Canaanite slave forever. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory,</b> and one is prohibited from freeing his Canaanite slave.",
      "<b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael? Since it is written</b> with regard to Canaanites: <b>“You shall save alive nothing that breathes”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:16), <b>it was necessary to write: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), <b>as well,</b> in order <b>to permit one from any of the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite woman and she bore him a child.</b> This verse teaches <b>that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child as a slave, as he is not included in the mitzva “You shall save alive nothing that breathes” that was stated with regard to full-fledged Canaanites. Therefore, this verse cannot be teaching that it is mandatory.",
      "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one from</b> any of <b>the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite woman, and she bore him a child, that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child <b>as a slave? The verse states: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them may you buy”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). This verse permits the purchase of slaves from among those individuals who are not members of the Canaanite nations, even if they settle in Eretz Yisrael.",
      "The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite</b> man <b>who engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman from</b> one of <b>the</b> other <b>nations and she bore him a child, that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child <b>as a slave,</b> despite the fact that his father is a Canaanite. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Which they have given birth to in your land,”</b> teaching that one is permitted to purchase slaves only <b>from the</b> ones who are <b>born in your land</b> but whose paternal origins are from other lands, <b>but not from the</b> ones who already <b>reside in your land,</b> i.e., ones who have a Canaanite father.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the words in the same verse: <b>“Of them may you buy.”</b> Once the <i>halakha</i> is already taught that one may purchase as a slave the child of a Canaanite woman and a man from another nation, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46)? It is stated <b>to</b> teach that it is <b>mandatory</b> to enslave a Canaanite slave forever.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever,” teaches that you can enslave <b>“of them,” but not of your brethren,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to enslave a fellow Jew, even a slave, forever.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The prohibition against enslaving <b>your brethren is derived from the latter</b> phrase <b>of the verse,</b> where it is explicitly stated: <b>“But over your brethren the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigor”</b> (Leviticus 25:46).",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: He holds that <b>since it is written: “But over your brethren,”</b> which explicitly states that it is prohibited to subjugate a Jew forever, <b>it also writes</b> with regard to Canaanites <b>“of them,”</b> but that phrase does not teach any novel <i>halakha</i>, <b>because of</b> the reason <b>that was taught by the school of Rabbi Yishmael.

      "§ The Gemara discusses matters related to sin and sexual impropriety. <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Licentious</b> behavior <b>in a home</b> causes damage <b>like a worm [<i>karya</i>]</b> causes damage <b>to sesame [<i>shumeshema</i>].

      "<b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Initially, before the Jewish people sinned, the Divine Presence resided with each and every one</b> of them, <b>as it is stated: “For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15). <b>Once they sinned, the Divine Presence withdrew from them, as it is stated</b> in that same verse: <b>“That He see no unseemly matter in you, and turn away from you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15), teaching that when there is an “unseemly matter” among the Jewish people, the Divine Presence no longer resides among them.",

      "<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The transgression <b>is chained to him</b> and accompanies him <b>like a dog, as it is stated</b> concerning Joseph’s refusal to commit adultery with the wife of Potiphar: <b>“That he listened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her”</b> (Genesis 39:10), which is understood to mean: If he would agree <b>“to lie by her” in this world,</b> the result would be that he would have <b>“to be with her”</b> forever, as the transgression would accompany him <b>to the World-to-Come.</b>",
      "§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the number of witnesses necessary for different elements of the process of a woman becoming a <i>sota</i>. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (31a) with regard to the credibility of one witness who testifies concerning a woman’s infidelity: The <i>halakha</i> that one witness is deemed credible concerning defilement needs to be stated, <b>as, by right,</b> it <b>should</b> not <b>have been</b> deemed credible based on the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference:",
      "<b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>the first testimony</b> concerning seclusion, <b>which does not forbid her</b> to her husband with <b>an irrevocable prohibition,</b> as the woman can be found innocent, permitting her again to her husband by drinking the bitter water, it <b>is not established with fewer than two</b> witnesses, as that mishna is written in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, who stated (2a) that testimony of two witnesses must be provided by two witnesses, then with regard to <b>the final testimony</b> concerning defilement, <b>which forbids her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition, is it not logical that it not be established with fewer than two</b> witnesses?",
      "Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states: “And there is no witness against her”</b> (Numbers 5:13), teaching that <b>any</b> testimony <b>that there is against her</b> with regard to her defilement is sufficient, and two witnesses are not required.",
      "The mishna asks: <b>And now</b> that it is established that one witness suffices to testify with regard to defilement, <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference can be made <b>with regard to the first testimony</b> of seclusion: <b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>the final testimony</b> concerning defilement, <b>which forbids her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition,</b> yet it <b>is established with one witness,</b> then with regard to <b>the first testimony, which does not forbid her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition, is it not logical that it should be established with</b> only <b>one witness?</b>",
      "Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states:</b> “If a man marries a woman and lives with her and it will be that she not find favor in his eyes, <b>because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>davar</i>] about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there,</b> in the verses concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of monetary matters, <b>it states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter [<i>davar</i>] be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established <b>by the mouth of two witnesses, so too here,</b> the “matter” of her seclusion must be established <b>by the mouth of two</b> witnesses.",
      "The Gemara asks: Is <b>this</b> need for two witnesses <b>derived from: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? <b>It is derived from:</b> “And there is no witness [<i>ed</i>] <b>against her [<i>bah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:13), which was explained to mean there were not two witnesses, but only one, who testified concerning her defilement (2a). The Gemara above (2b) derives from the term “<i>bah</i>,” which could also be understood as: <b>With regard to it,</b> that in this matter of defilement one witness suffices, <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> And one also derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b> Therefore, there must be two witnesses to testify about both the warning and the seclusion. The mishna <b>should have</b> given this inference as the source for requiring two witnesses for seclusion, and not the juxtaposition of “matter” and “matter.”",
      "The Gemara answers: <b>That is also what he is saying.</b> The mishna should read: <b>The verse states:</b> “And there is no witness <b>against her [<i>bah</i>],”</b> teaching that: <b>With regard to it [<i>bah</i>], but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> And one also derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b>",
      "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>defilement in general, without</b> a prior <b>warning and without</b> witnesses to <b>seclusion, from where do we</b> derive <b>that one witness is not deemed credible? Here it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there it is stated: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established by <b>two witnesses, so too here,</b> with regard to defilement it is established by <b>two witnesses.</b>",
      "<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): In the mishna quoted above, <b>which is the first testimony? This</b> is referring to the <b>testimony of seclusion.</b> Which is <b>the final testimony? This</b> is referring to the <b>testimony of defilement.</b>"

        "<b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse serves to render it prohibited for a priest to become impure to bury a limb, then <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> “And for his sister a virgin, that is near to him, that has had no husband, <b>for her,” and</b> then <b>be silent. Why do I</b> need the verse to write: <b>“May he become impure”? Learn from</b> the additional phrase that making himself impure is mandatory.",
        "<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> explain the additional phrase? <b>Since</b> the verse <b>wrote: “For her,”</b> it <b>also wrote: “May he become impure,” for</b> the same reason <b>as was taught by the school of Rabbi Yishmael. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Every passage</b> in the Torah <b>that was stated and repeated, was repeated only for the novel element introduced therein.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the verse serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that a priest may not become impure in order to bury a limb, and that would account for the repetition of the phrase “may he become impure” as well.",
        "The Gemara discusses the third dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The verse states: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), i.e., the <i>halakha</i> that one keeps his Canaanite slave forever, is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> One is not enjoined against emancipating a Canaanite slave, but one is permitted to keep a Canaanite slave forever. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory,</b> and one is prohibited from freeing his Canaanite slave.",
        "<b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael? Since it is written</b> with regard to Canaanites: <b>“You shall save alive nothing that breathes”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:16), <b>it was necessary to write: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), <b>as well,</b> in order <b>to permit one from any of the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite woman and she bore him a child.</b> This verse teaches <b>that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child as a slave, as he is not included in the mitzva “You shall save alive nothing that breathes” that was stated with regard to full-fledged Canaanites. Therefore, this verse cannot be teaching that it is mandatory.",
        "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one from</b> any of <b>the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite woman, and she bore him a child, that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child <b>as a slave? The verse states: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them may you buy”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). This verse permits the purchase of slaves from among those individuals who are not members of the Canaanite nations, even if they settle in Eretz Yisrael.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite</b> man <b>who engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman from</b> one of <b>the</b> other <b>nations and she bore him a child, that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child <b>as a slave,</b> despite the fact that his father is a Canaanite. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Which they have given birth to in your land,”</b> teaching that one is permitted to purchase slaves only <b>from the</b> ones who are <b>born in your land</b> but whose paternal origins are from other lands, <b>but not from the</b> ones who already <b>reside in your land,</b> i.e., ones who have a Canaanite father.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the words in the same verse: <b>“Of them may you buy.”</b> Once the <i>halakha</i> is already taught that one may purchase as a slave the child of a Canaanite woman and a man from another nation, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46)? It is stated <b>to</b> teach that it is <b>mandatory</b> to enslave a Canaanite slave forever.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever,” teaches that you can enslave <b>“of them,” but not of your brethren,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to enslave a fellow Jew, even a slave, forever.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The prohibition against enslaving <b>your brethren is derived from the latter</b> phrase <b>of the verse,</b> where it is explicitly stated: <b>“But over your brethren the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigor”</b> (Leviticus 25:46).",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: He holds that <b>since it is written: “But over your brethren,”</b> which explicitly states that it is prohibited to subjugate a Jew forever, <b>it also writes</b> with regard to Canaanites <b>“of them,”</b> but that phrase does not teach any novel <i>halakha</i>, <b>because of</b> the reason <b>that was taught by the school of Rabbi Yishmael. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Every passage</b> in the Torah <b>that was stated and repeated, was repeated only for the novel element introduced therein.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the verse serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that one may enslave a Canaanite forever, and that would account for the ostensibly superfluous phrase “of them.”",
        "§ The Gemara discusses matters related to sin and sexual impropriety. <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Licentious</b> behavior <b>in a home</b> causes damage <b>like a worm [<i>karya</i>]</b> causes damage <b>to sesame [<i>shumeshema</i>]. And Rav Ḥisda says: Anger in a home</b> causes damage <b>like a worm</b> causes damage <b>to sesame.</b> The Gemara comments: Both <b>this and that,</b> i.e., that licentious behavior and anger destroy a home, were said <b>with regard to the woman</b> of the house, <b>but with regard to the man,</b> although these behaviors are improper, <b>we do not have</b> the same extreme consequences <b>with regard to it,</b> as the woman’s role in the home is more significant, resulting in a more detrimental result if she acts improperly.",
        "<b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Initially, before the Jewish people sinned, the Divine Presence resided with each and every one</b> of them, <b>as it is stated: “For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15). <b>Once they sinned, the Divine Presence withdrew from them, as it is stated</b> in that same verse: <b>“That He see no unseemly matter in you, and turn away from you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15), teaching that when there is an “unseemly matter” among the Jewish people, the Divine Presence no longer resides among them.",
        "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who fulfills one mitzva in this world,</b> that mitzva <b>precedes him and goes before him to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your righteousness shall go before you,</b> the glory of the Lord shall be your reward” (Isaiah 58:8). <b>And anyone who commits one transgression in this world, it shrouds him and goes before him to the Day of Judgment, as it is stated: “The paths of their way do wind, they go up into the waste, and are lost”</b> (Job 6:18).",
        "<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The transgression <b>is chained to him</b> and accompanies him <b>like a dog, as it is stated</b> concerning Joseph’s refusal to commit adultery with the wife of Potiphar: <b>“That he listened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her”</b> (Genesis 39:10), which is understood to mean: If he would agree <b>“to lie by her” in this world,</b> the result would be that he would have <b>“to be with her”</b> forever, as the transgression would accompany him <b>to the World-to-Come.</b>",
        "§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the number of witnesses necessary for different elements of the process of a woman becoming a <i>sota</i>. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (31a) with regard to the credibility of one witness who testifies concerning a woman’s infidelity: The <i>halakha</i> that one witness is deemed credible concerning defilement needs to be stated, <b>as, by right,</b> it <b>should</b> not <b>have been</b> deemed credible based on the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference:",
        "<b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>the first testimony</b> concerning seclusion, <b>which does not forbid her</b> to her husband with <b>an irrevocable prohibition,</b> as the woman can be found innocent, permitting her again to her husband by drinking the bitter water, it <b>is not established with fewer than two</b> witnesses, as that mishna is written in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, who stated (2a) that testimony of two witnesses must be provided by two witnesses, then with regard to <b>the final testimony</b> concerning defilement, <b>which forbids her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition, is it not logical that it not be established with fewer than two</b> witnesses?",
        "Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states: “And there is no witness against her”</b> (Numbers 5:13), teaching that <b>any</b> testimony <b>that there is against her</b> with regard to her defilement is sufficient, and two witnesses are not required.",
        "The mishna asks: <b>And now</b> that it is established that one witness suffices to testify with regard to defilement, <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference can be made <b>with regard to the first testimony</b> of seclusion: <b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>the final testimony</b> concerning defilement, <b>which forbids her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition,</b> yet it <b>is established with one witness,</b> then with regard to <b>the first testimony, which does not forbid her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition, is it not logical that it should be established with</b> only <b>one witness?</b>",
        "Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states:</b> “If a man marries a woman and lives with her and it will be that she not find favor in his eyes, <b>because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>davar</i>] about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there,</b> in the verses concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of monetary matters, <b>it states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter [<i>davar</i>] be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established <b>by the mouth of two witnesses, so too here,</b> the “matter” of her seclusion must be established <b>by the mouth of two</b> witnesses.",
        "The Gemara asks: Is <b>this</b> need for two witnesses <b>derived from: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? <b>It is derived from:</b> “And there is no witness [<i>ed</i>] <b>against her [<i>bah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:13), which was explained to mean there were not two witnesses, but only one, who testified concerning her defilement (2a). The Gemara above (2b) derives from the term “<i>bah</i>,” which could also be understood as: <b>With regard to it,</b> that in this matter of defilement one witness suffices, <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> And one also derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b> Therefore, there must be two witnesses to testify about both the warning and the seclusion. The mishna <b>should have</b> given this inference as the source for requiring two witnesses for seclusion, and not the juxtaposition of “matter” and “matter.”",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>That is also what he is saying.</b> The mishna should read: <b>The verse states:</b> “And there is no witness <b>against her [<i>bah</i>],”</b> teaching that: <b>With regard to it [<i>bah</i>], but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> And one also derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b>",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>defilement in general, without</b> a prior <b>warning and without</b> witnesses to <b>seclusion, from where do we</b> derive <b>that one witness is not deemed credible? Here it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there it is stated: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established by <b>two witnesses, so too here,</b> with regard to defilement it is established by <b>two witnesses.</b>",
        "<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): In the mishna quoted above, <b>which is the first testimony? This</b> is referring to the <b>testimony of seclusion.</b> Which is <b>the final testimony? This</b> is referring to the <b>testimony of defilement.</b>"

        "The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: <b>And what is the measure of seclusion,</b> i.e., how is the seclusion of a <i>sota</i> defined? The measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>intercourse,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse.</b>",
        "The <i>baraita</i> quotes several practical examples of this period of time. This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>circling a palm</b> tree; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>for mixing a cup</b> of wine with water, with the total volume of a quarter-<i>log</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to drink</b> that cup of wine.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> quotes several more examples. <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to roast an egg. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to swallow it. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to swallow three eggs one after another. Rabbi Elazar ben Yirmeya says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>a weaver [<i>gardi</i>] to tie a string [<i>nima</i>].</b>",
        "<b>Ḥanin ben Pineḥas says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time <b>that</b> a woman <b>may</b> need to <b>extend her hand into her mouth to remove a wood chip</b> from between her teeth. The Sage <b>Peleimu says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time <b>that she may</b> need to <b>extend her hand into a basket</b> in order <b>to take a loaf</b> of bread. He adds: <b>Although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof</b> from a verse <b>for the matter,</b> there is <b>an allusion to the matter</b> from the verse: <b>“For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26).",
        "The <i>baraita</i> stated that the measure of seclusion is equivalent to the time needed for defilement, which is equivalent to the time needed to perform sexual intercourse, which is equivalent to the time needed to perform the initial stage of intercourse, and it added nine practical examples of that length of time. The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> times when one should have sufficed?",
        "The Gemara answers: All three <b>are necessary, as if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> only: <b>Equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement, I would say</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time for <b>her defilement and her appeasement,</b> i.e., the amount of time needed to convince her to engage in sexual intercourse. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>sexual intercourse</b> alone.",
        "<b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> only: The measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>sexual intercourse, I would say</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for the <b>completion of</b> the act of <b>intercourse.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse.</b>",
        "<b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> only: The measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse, I would say</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse and her appeasement.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement,</b> which does not include appeasement. The <i>baraita</i> concludes by offering a practical measure: <b>And what is the measure</b> of the <b>equivalent</b> amount of time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse?</b> It is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>circling a palm</b> tree. Other Sages then offered their own practical examples.",
        "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:2): The verse states: <b>“And she was</b> defiled <b>secretly”</b> (Numbers 5:13), <b>and we have not heard what is the measure</b> of <b>seclusion. When it says</b> in that verse: <b>“And she was defiled</b> secretly,” <b>you must say</b> that the measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>sexual intercourse,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for the <b>returning of a palm</b> tree; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>mixing a cup</b> of wine with water, with the total volume of a quarter-<i>log</i>. <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to drink</b> that cup of wine. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to roast an egg.

        "The Gemara now addresses several contradictions between this <i>baraita</i> and the one quoted earlier. The Gemara first comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that <b>circling a palm tree is</b> the same as the <b>returning of a palm</b> tree. The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> it is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>circling a palm</b> tree <b>and Rabbi Eliezer disagreed with him,</b> while <b>here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> himself <b>says</b> it is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for the <b>returning of a palm</b> tree; doesn’t this contradict what he stated in the previous <i>baraita</i>?",
        "To resolve this contradiction, <b>Abaye says:</b> These measures are not the same, as <b>circling</b> is referring to the amount of time it takes for one to circle a palm tree <b>by foot,</b> and <b>returning</b> is referring to the amount of time it takes for a palm branch blown <b>by the wind</b> to revert to its prior position.",
        "<b>Rav Ashi asks:</b> This <b>returning</b> of the palm branch <b>by the wind,</b> is this the time only <b>so that it goes</b> forward with the wind <b>and returns</b> to its place one time, not including the time it is still moving back and forth due to the wind? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is the time <b>so that it goes</b> forward with the wind <b>and comes back and returns</b> until it <b>settles in its place.</b> The Gemara states: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",

        "the case where <b>there are witnesses for her in a country overseas</b> who can testify that she engaged in sexual intercourse, when the bitter water will not evaluate her faithfulness. Therefore, Rabbi Shimon should be concerned that such a dispensation will result in the defamation of the untainted women who drank and were unaffected, as people will view them as guilty women who were not affected because there were witnesses overseas.",
        "The Gemara answers: The case of witnesses in a country overseas is <b>not common,</b> and therefore no one will assume that that is the reason why the woman was not affected. By contrast, a woman having merit is common.",
        "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna details the procedure for administering the drinking of the bitter water of a <i>sota</i>. <b>What does</b> her husband <b>do with her</b> after she secluded herself with the man about whom she had been warned? <b>He brings her to the court that is</b> found <b>in that location, and</b> the court <b>provides him</b> with <b>two Torah scholars</b> to accompany him, <b>lest he engage in sexual intercourse with her on the way</b> to the Temple, which is not only prohibited but will also prevent the bitter water from evaluating her. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Her husband is trusted with regard to her,</b> so there is no need to provide scholars to accompany him.",
        "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara assumes that the requirement for there to be two Torah scholars is to avoid the prohibition against a woman being alone with a man. The Gemara notes: <b>Two</b> additional men <b>and he,</b> the husband, <b>are three</b> people altogether. <b>Let us say</b> that <b>this</b> mishna <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> When they taught that it is permitted for a woman to be secluded with two men, <b>they taught</b> that this is permitted <b>only in the town</b> (see <i>Kiddushin</i> 80b). <b>But on the way,</b> when traveling, this is not permitted <b>unless there are three</b> men with the woman. The reason for this stringency is that if there are only two men with her, <b>perhaps one will need to relieve himself</b> and will seek privacy, <b>and it will be found that one of them is in seclusion with a woman forbidden to him.</b>",
        "The Gemara refutes this assumption: <b>No, here,</b> in the case of a <i>sota</i>, <b>this is the reason</b> why there is a requirement for two scholars, <b>so that there are two witnesses with regard to her,</b> i.e., there will be two witnesses to testify in the event that the husband engages in sexual intercourse with her on the way to the Temple. The reason is not to avoid the prohibition against her being alone with a man, as one scholar would suffice for that.",
        "The mishna teaches that the husband is provided with Torah scholars. The Gemara further comments: <b>Torah scholars, yes; anyone</b> else, <b>no.</b> It is specifically Torah scholars who are provided to accompany the husband and wife. <b>Let us say</b> that this mishna <b>supports another</b> statement <b>of Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> When they taught that it is permitted for a woman to be secluded with two men, <b>they taught</b> that this is permitted <b>only</b> with regard <b>to</b> men of <b>fit</b> morals. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>those of loose morals,</b> she may <b>not</b> be secluded <b>even with ten</b> men. The Gemara adds: <b>There was an incident and ten</b> men <b>carried out</b> a woman <b>on a bier,</b> as if she were dead, and engaged in sexual intercourse with her.",
        "The Gemara refutes this assumption: <b>No, here,</b> in the case of a <i>sota</i>, <b>this is the reason</b> why there is a requirement for two scholars, <b>that they know</b> how <b>to</b> properly <b>warn him</b> not to engage in sexual intercourse with her. Therefore, this mishna does not support the opinion of Rav.",
        "§ The Gemara now discusses Rabbi Yehuda’s statement in the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Her husband</b> is trusted with regard to her. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (1:2): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Her husband is trusted due to an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as</b> in the case of <b>a menstruating woman, who is</b> prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse with her husband <b>by</b> penalty of <b><i>karet</i>, her husband is</b> nevertheless <b>trusted with regard to her,</b> as he is permitted to seclude himself with her, so too, with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>, who is</b> prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse with her husband only <b>by</b> penalty of <b>a prohibition,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he should be trusted?",
        "<b>And the Rabbis</b> say: <b>That provides</b> support for the contrary opinion, as these considerations lead to the opposite conclusion. <b>A menstruating woman</b> is forbidden <b>by</b> penalty of <b><i>karet</i>.</b> This is <b>a stringent</b> prohibition <b>for him, and</b> this is why <b>he is trusted</b> not to engage in sexual intercourse with her. By contrast, <b>a <i>sota</i></b> is forbidden to him only <b>by a prohibition.</b> This is <b>not a stringent</b> prohibition <b>to him, and he is</b> therefore <b>not trusted</b> with her.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in fact <b>derive this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>But Rabbi Yehuda derives it from a verse, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest”</b> (Numbers 5:15), teaches that <b>by Torah</b> law <b>the man</b> alone <b>brings his wife</b> to the Temple, <b>but the Sages said:</b> The court <b>provides him</b> with <b>two Torah scholars</b> to accompany him, <b>lest he engage in sexual intercourse with her on the way</b> to the Temple.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> records a second opinion. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Her husband is trusted with regard to her</b> based on <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as a menstruating woman, who is</b> prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse with her husband <b>by</b> penalty of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and <b>her husband is</b> nevertheless <b>trusted with regard to her,</b> then with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>, who is</b> prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse with her husband <b>by</b> penalty of only <b>a prohibition,</b> should he <b>not all the more so</b> be trusted?",
        "The Sages <b>said to him: No, if you say</b> that this is true <b>with regard to a menstruating woman,</b> the reason he is trusted is not due to the severity of the prohibition. Rather, he is trusted <b>because she has</b> the ability to become <b>permitted</b> to her husband after her menstrual flow has ceased and she has immersed in a ritual bath. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to a <i>sota</i>, who</b> potentially <b>does not have</b> the ability to become <b>permitted</b> to her husband due to her suspected adultery? <b>And</b> proof to the notion that people will more readily commit illicit acts that are permanently prohibited comes from the verse that <b>states: “Stolen waters are sweet</b> and bread eaten in secret is pleasing” (Proverbs 9:17). Consequently, there is a concern that the husband will engage in sexual intercourse with his <i>sota</i> wife if not accompanied by scholars.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> quotes a third opinion. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: By Torah</b> law, <b>the man</b> alone <b>brings his wife</b> to the Temple, <b>as is stated: “Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest.”</b> This <i>baraita</i> states explicitly that Rabbi Yehuda derives this <i>halakha</i> from the verse itself, not from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference.",
        "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda <b>first said to them</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>and they refuted it</b> as mentioned above, <b>and</b> he <b>then said to them</b> the derivation from the <b>verse.</b>",
        "The Gemara clarifies: Apparently, the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> in the <i>baraita</i>, who also cites the verse as proof that by Torah law the husband alone brings his wife to the priest. The Gemara explains: The difference <b>between them</b> concerns the following clause: <b>But the Sages said</b> that the court provides him with two Torah scholars to accompany him. The first <i>tanna</i> holds that the Sages require two scholars to accompany the husband and wife, while Rabbi Yehuda holds that they do not.",
        "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna details the next stage of the process. <b>They would bring her up to the Sanhedrin that was in Jerusalem, and</b> the judges would <b>threaten her</b> in order that she admit her sin. <b>And</b> this was done <b>in the manner that they</b> would <b>threaten witnesses</b> testifying <b>in</b> cases of <b>capital</b> law. In those cases, the judges would explain to the witnesses the gravity of their testimony by stressing the value of human life. Here too, the judges would attempt to convince the woman to admit her sin, to avoid the loss of her life.",
        "<b>And</b> additionally, the judge would <b>say to her: My daughter, wine causes a great deal</b> of immoral behavior, <b>levity causes a great deal</b> of immoral behavior, <b>immaturity causes a great deal</b> of immoral behavior, and <b>bad neighbors cause a great deal</b> of immoral behavior. The judge encouraged her to admit her sin by explaining to her that he understands that there may have been mitigating factors.",
        "The judge then continues: <b>Act for the sake of His great name, so that</b> God’s name, <b>which is written in sanctity, shall not be erased on the water.</b> If the woman admits to having committed adultery, the scroll upon which the name of God is written will not be erased. <b>And</b> additionally, the judge <b>says in her presence matters that are not worthy of being heard</b> by <b>her and all her father’s family,</b> in order to encourage her to admit her sin, as the Gemara will explain.",
        "<b>If</b> after the judge’s warning <b>she says: I am defiled,</b> she writes <b>a receipt</b> for <b>her marriage contract.</b> That is, she writes a receipt indicating that she has no claims on her husband with regard to the sum written in her marriage contract, as a woman who admits to adultery forfeits her right to this payment. <b>And she is</b> then <b>divorced</b> from her husband.",
        "<b>But if</b> after the warning <b>she</b> maintains her innocence and <b>says: I am pure, they bring her up to the Eastern Gate, which is at the opening of</b> the <b>Gate of Nicanor, because</b> three rites were performed <b>there: They give the <i>sota</i> women</b> the bitter water <b>to drink, and they purify women who have given birth</b> (see Leviticus 12:6–8), <b>and they purify the lepers</b> (see Leviticus 14:10–20).",
        "The mishna continues describing the <i>sota</i> rite. <b>And the priest grabs hold of her clothing</b> and pulls them, unconcerned about what happens to the clothing. <b>If</b> the clothes <b>are torn,</b> so <b>they are torn; if the stitches come apart,</b> so <b>they come apart.</b> And he pulls her clothing <b>until he reveals her heart,</b> i.e., her chest. <b>And</b> then <b>he unbraids her hair. Rabbi Yehuda says: If her heart was attractive he would not reveal it, and if her hair was attractive he would not unbraid</b> it.",
        "If <b>she was dressed in white</b> garments, <b>he</b> would now <b>cover her with black</b> garments. If <b>she was wearing gold adornments,</b>"

        "<b>or chokers [<i>katliyot</i>],</b> or <b>nose rings, or</b> finger <b>rings, they removed them from her in order to render her unattractive. And afterward</b> the priest <b>would bring an Egyptian rope</b> fashioned from palm fibers, <b>and he would tie it above her breasts.</b>",
        "<b>And anyone who desires to watch her may come to watch, except for her slaves and maidservants,</b> who are not permitted to watch <b>because her heart is emboldened by them,</b> as seeing one’s slaves reinforces one’s feeling of pride, and their presence may cause her to maintain her innocence. <b>And all of the women are permitted to watch her, as it is stated:</b> “Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, <b>that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness”</b> (Ezekiel 23:48).",
        "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks concerning the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>sota</i> is brought before the Sanhedrin: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the words <b>“<i>tora</i>”</b> and <b>“<i>tora</i>.”</b> It <b>is written here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall execute upon her all this law [<i>tora</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:30), <b>and</b> it <b>is written there,</b> with regard to a rebellious Elder, who must go to the place chosen by God and follow the ruling of the Sanhedrin: <b>“According to the law [<i>tora</i>] that they shall teach you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:11). <b>Just as there</b> the verse is referring to what occurs <b>in</b> the presence of the Sanhedrin of <b>seventy-one</b> judges, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, the verse is referring to what occurs <b>in</b> the presence of the Sanhedrin of <b>seventy-one</b> judges.",
        "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And they threaten her</b> in order that she admit her sin, to obviate the need to erase God’s name. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (1:6): <b>In the same manner that they threaten her so that she will not drink, so too, they threaten her so that she will drink,</b> as <b>they say to her: My daughter, if the matter is clear to you that you are pure, arise for</b> the sake of <b>your clear</b> position <b>and drink.</b> If you are innocent you have nothing to fear, <b>because the bitter water is similar only to a dry poison placed on the flesh. If there is a wound</b> there, the poison will <b>penetrate and enter</b> the blood stream, but if <b>there is no wound there, it does not have any effect.</b> This teaches that the woman is warned not to drink if she is guilty, but if she is not guilty she is encouraged to drink. There is no mention of the latter in the mishna.",
        "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> the mishna is referring to <b>before the scroll was erased,</b> and at that point the woman is warned only not to drink if she is guilty, so that the name of God will not be erased. <b>There</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>after the scroll was erased.</b> Then she is warned that if she is innocent she should drink because if she now refuses to drink, it will turn out that the scroll was erased for no purpose.",
        "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the judge <b>says in her presence</b> matters that are not worthy of being heard by her and all her father’s family in order to encourage her to admit her sin. The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that details what was said. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The judge <b>says in her presence words of homiletical</b> interpretation <b>and</b> mentions <b>incidents that happened</b> to previous generations that are recorded <b>in the early</b> prophetic <b>writings. For example,</b> they expound the following verse: <b>“That wise men told and did not hide from their fathers”</b> (Job 15:18); this teaches that even during the time of the forefathers, there were people who admitted their sins despite the shame they incurred.",
        "For example, <b>Judah admitted</b> that he sinned with Tamar <b>and was not embarrassed</b> to do so, and <b>what was his end? He inherited the life of the World-to-Come. Reuben admitted</b> that he lay with his father’s concubine Bilhah <b>and was not embarrassed,</b> and <b>what was his end? He</b> too <b>inherited the life of the World-to-Come.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what is their reward?</b> The Gemara interjects: <b>What is their reward?</b> Their reward was clearly <b>as we say,</b> that they inherited the life of the World-to-Come. The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather,</b> the second question was: <b>What is their reward in this world?</b> The Gemara answers by citing the next verse in the book of Job: <b>“To them alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them”</b> (Job 15:19). Judah was given the kingship, and Reuben inherited a portion of land in the Transjordan before the other tribes.",
        "The Gemara questions the source for Reuben’s admission. <b>Granted, with regard to Judah we have found</b> a source <b>that he admitted</b> his sin with Tamar, <b>as it is written: “And Judah acknowledged them and said: She is more righteous than I”</b> (Genesis 38:26). Judah admitted that he was the one who had impregnated Tamar. <b>But from where do we</b> derive <b>that Reuben admitted</b> his sin?",
        "The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> concerning Reuben and Judah in Moses’ blessing of the tribes at the end of his life: <b>“Let Reuben live and not die in that his men become few”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:6), and immediately afterward, in the following verse, it is stated: <b>“And this for Judah,</b> and he said: Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; his hands shall contend for him, and You shall be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7). What is the connection between the blessing of Reuben and that of Judah, juxtaposed with the conjunction “and”?",
        "Rabbi Yoḥanan says: <b>All those years that the Jewish people were in the desert, the bones of Judah,</b> which the Jewish people took with them from Egypt along with the bones of his brothers, <b>were rolling</b> around <b>in the coffin, until Moses arose and asked for compassion on</b> Judah’s behalf. Moses <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, who served as the impetus for Reuben that he admit</b> his sin, through which he merited a blessing and was not excluded from the count of the twelve sons of Jacob (see Genesis 35:22)? It was <b>Judah,</b> as Reuben saw him confess his sin, and thereby did the same. Moses continues in the next verse: <b>“And this for Judah,”</b> as if to say: Is this Judah’s reward for serving as an example of confessing to one’s sins, that his bones roll around?",
        "<b>Immediately</b> after Moses prayed, the verse states: <b>“Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7). <b>His bones</b> then <b>entered</b> their <b>sockets [<i>shafa</i>],</b> and his skeleton was reassembled. <b>But</b> the angels still <b>did not elevate</b> him <b>into the heavenly study hall.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“And bring him in unto his people”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7), i.e., those in the heavenly study hall. This prayer was accepted, <b>but he</b> still <b>did not know</b> how <b>to deliberate</b> in Torah matters <b>with the</b> heavenly <b>sages.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“His hands shall contend for him”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7), meaning that he should have the ability to contend with them in study. But still <b>he was unable to draw</b> conclusions from <b>his discussion in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“And You shall be a help against his adversaries”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7).",
        "The Gemara discusses the propriety of admitting one’s sins in public. <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>Judah,</b> it was proper <b>that he admitted</b> his sin in public, as he did so <b>in order that Tamar not be burned</b> innocently. <b>But why did Reuben admit</b> his sin in public? <b>But didn’t Rav Sheshet say: I</b> consider one <b>who specifies his sins</b> in public to be <b>brazen,</b> as one who does so indicates that he is not embarrassed by his actions? The Gemara answers: The reason he admitted his sin in public was <b>in order that his brothers should not be suspected</b> of having committed the deed.",
        "§ The mishna teaches: <b>If</b> after the judge’s warning <b>she says: I am defiled,</b> she writes a receipt for her marriage contract. The Gemara comments: <b>You</b> can <b>learn from this</b> mishna <b>that one writes a receipt</b> to serve as proof that a debt has been paid rather than tearing the promissory note. This matter is the subject of a dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> in tractate <i>Bava Batra</i> (170b).",
        "<b>Abaye said: Teach</b> in the mishna differently. Rather than understanding that she writes a receipt, explain it to mean: <b>She tears</b> her marriage contract. <b>Rava said to him: But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> explicitly that <b>she writes a receipt. Rather,</b> to explain the mishna, <b>Rava said: We are dealing with a place in</b> which <b>they do not write a marriage contract,</b> as they rely on the rabbinical ordinance that all wives are entitled to the sum of a standard marriage contract upon divorce or being widowed, even if no marriage contract has been written. Because there is no marriage contract to tear, a receipt is written so that the man can prove that he no longer has a monetary obligation. However, generally, it is possible that the document would be torn, and no proof can be adduced from this mishna.",
        "§ The mishna teaches: <b>But if</b> after the warning <b>she</b> maintains her innocence and <b>says: I am pure, they</b> would <b>bring her up to the Eastern Gate.</b> The Gemara asks: Would <b>they bring her up?</b>"

      "The contradiction between one ruling <b>of the Rabbis and</b> the other ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> is <b>not difficult as well. Here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, <b>what is the reason</b> that her hair and body are uncovered? <b>Because</b> of what is stated in the verse, that other women should be warned: “Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, <b>that all women may be chastened</b> not to do after your lewdness” (Ezekiel 23:48). <b>There,</b> with regard to stoning, <b>you have no greater chastening than</b> seeing <b>this</b> stoning itself.",
      "<b>And if you would say that two</b> forms of chastening, both stoning and humiliation, <b>should be done with her, Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> The <b>verse states: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), teaching that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Therefore, when putting a woman to death by stoning, she should not be humiliated in the process.",
      "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> the statement <b>of Rav Naḥman is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> and according to Rabbi Yehuda there is no mitzva to select a compassionate death. The Gemara refutes this: <b>No,</b> it may be <b>that everyone agrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, and here they disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds:</b> Minimizing <b>one’s degradation is preferable to him than</b> minimizing <b>his physical pain.</b> Therefore, the Rabbis view the more compassionate death as one without degradation, even if wearing clothes will increase the pain of the one being executed, as the clothes will absorb the blow and prolong death. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds that</b> minimizing <b>physical pain is preferable to a person than</b> minimizing <b>his degradation,</b> and therefore the one being executed prefers to be stoned unclothed, without any chance of the clothing prolonging the death, although this adds to the degradation.",
      "§ The mishna teaches: If <b>she was dressed in white</b> garments, he would cover her with black garments. A Sage <b>taught: If black</b> garments <b>are becoming to her,</b> then <b>she is covered in unsightly garments.</b>",
      "The mishna teaches: If <b>she was wearing gold adornments</b> or other jewelry, they are removed from her. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious? Now</b> that the priest <b>renders her unattractive</b> by uncovering her and dressing her in unsightly garments, <b>is it necessary</b> to teach that they remove <b>these</b> adornments from her? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>with these</b> adornments on her, <b>she has more degradation, as people say</b> in a known aphorism: <b>Undressed, naked, and wearing shoes.</b> This means that a naked person who wears shoes emphasizes the fact that he is naked. Perhaps one would think that by a <i>sota</i> wearing jewelry, her nakedness is emphasized and her degradation is amplified. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.",
      "The mishna continues: <b>And afterward</b> the priest <b>would bring</b> an Egyptian <b>rope,</b> and he would tie it above her breasts. <b>Rabbi Abba raised a dilemma before Rav Huna: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether the lack of <b>an Egyptian rope will preclude</b> the performance of the rite <b>with regard to a <i>sota</i>?</b> Does any means of tying suffice? Perhaps the primary function of the rope <b>is so that her clothes will not fall off her, and</b> therefore even <b>a small ribbon [<i>tziltzul</i>] would also suffice. Or, perhaps</b> the rope is used <b>because</b> of what <b>the Master said: She girded</b> herself <b>with</b> a comely <b>ribbon</b> when she committed her transgression, and <b>therefore the priest brings</b> specifically <b>an Egyptian rope,</b> which is coarse, <b>and ties it above her breasts.</b> If that is the case, then the Egyptian rope should be <b>indispensable.</b>",
      "Rav Huna <b>said to him: You learned</b> the answer to this dilemma in a <i>baraita</i> that teaches: <b>And afterward</b> the priest <b>would bring an Egyptian rope</b> and he would tie it above her breasts, <b>so that her clothes would not fall off her.</b> The <i>baraita</i> states that the use of an Egyptian rope is primarily for holding up her clothing, and therefore use of specifically Egyptian rope is not essential.",
      "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And anyone who desires to watch her may watch,</b> except for her slaves and maidservants, who are not permitted to watch because her heart is emboldened by them. And all of the women are permitted to watch her. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> matter <b>is itself difficult,</b> as there is an internal contradiction in the mishna. First <b>you say: And anyone who desires to watch her may watch. Apparently,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether the onlookers are <b>men and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether they are <b>women;</b> all are permitted to observe the rite. <b>And then</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And all of the women are permitted to watch her,</b> which indicates <b>women, yes,</b> they may watch her, but <b>men, no,</b> they may not.",
      "<b>Abaye said: Interpret</b> the first statement, which permits all people to observe the <i>sota</i>, as pertaining <b>to women,</b> but men may not be onlookers. <b>Rava said to him: But</b> it <b>teaches</b> in that first statement that <b>anyone who desires to watch her may watch,</b> and one cannot limit this to women.",
      "<b>Rather, Rava said: Anyone who desires to watch her may watch,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether the onlookers are <b>men</b> and there <b>is no difference</b> whether they are <b>women. And</b> the next clause of the mishna teaches that <b>women are obligated to watch her, as is stated:</b> “Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, <b>that all women may be chastened not to do after your lewdness”</b> (Ezekiel 23:48).",
      "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna teaches lessons that can be derived from the actions and treatment of a <i>sota</i>. <b>With the measure that a person measures, he is measured with it.</b> For example, <b>she,</b> the <i>sota</i>, <b>adorned herself to</b> violate <b>a transgression, the Omnipresent</b> therefore decreed that <b>she</b> be <b>rendered unattractive; she exposed herself for</b> the purpose of violating <b>a transgression,</b> as she stood in places where she would be noticed by potential adulterers, so <b>the Omnipresent</b> therefore decreed that <b>her</b> body be <b>exposed</b> publicly; <b>she began her transgression with</b> her <b>thigh and afterward with</b> her <b>stomach, therefore the thigh is smitten first and then the stomach, and the rest of all</b> her <b>body</b> does <b>not escape</b> punishment.",
      "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yosef says: Although the measure</b> with regard to court-imposed capital punishment <b>has ceased,</b> as there is no court today empowered to adjudicate and apply corporal punishment, punishment that is suitable to be applied <b>with a measure</b> by God <b>has not ceased,</b> as a person is punished by Heaven in accordance with his sin.",
      "<b>As Rav Yosef says, and Rabbi Ḥiyya similarly teaches: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, although the Sanhedrin ceased,</b> the <b>four</b> types of court-imposed <b>capital punishment have not ceased.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But they have ceased;</b> court-imposed capital punishment is no longer given. <b>Rather,</b> the intention is: <b>The law of</b> the <b>four</b> types of court-imposed <b>capital punishment has not ceased.</b>",
      "The Gemara explains: How so? <b>One who is liable</b> to be executed by <b>stoning either falls from a roof or an animal mauls him</b> and breaks his bones. This death is similar to the experience of stoning, in which the one liable to be executed is pushed from a platform and his bones break from the impact of the fall. <b>One who is liable</b> to be executed by <b>burning either falls into a fire</b> and is burned <b>or a snake bites him,</b> as a snakebite causes a burning sensation. <b>One who is liable to</b> be executed by <b>slaying</b> of the sword <b>either is turned over to the authorities</b> and they execute him with a sword, <b>or robbers come upon him</b> and murder him. <b>One who is liable</b> to be executed by <b>strangling either drowns in a river</b> and is choked by the water <b>or dies of diphtheria [<i>seronekhi</i>],</b> which causes his throat to become clogged, and he dies.",
      "<b>It is taught</b> in a baraita in the <i>Tosefta</i> (3:1–5) that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that with the measure that a person measures, he is measured with it? As it is stated: “In full measure [<i>besase’a</i>], when you send her away, you contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8). In other words, in the measure, <i>bese’a</i>, that one used in one’s sin, God will contend with, i.e., punish, him.",
      "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the relatively large measurement of <b>a <i>se’a</i>,</b> which alludes to a significant sin. <b>From where</b> do I know <b>to include</b> even lesser sins that are comparable to smaller measurements, e.g., <b>a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>tarkav</i>] and a half-<i>tarkav</i>; a <i>kav</i> and a half-<i>kav</i>; a quarter-<i>kav</i> and half of a quarter-<i>kav</i>; an eighth-<i>kav</i> [<i>toman</i>] and an <i>ukla</i>,</b> which is one-thirty-second of a <i>kav</i>. <b>From where</b> is it derived that all these lesser sins are also dealt with in accordance with the measure of the sin? <b>The verse states: “For every boot [<i>sa’on</i>] stamped with fierceness,</b> and every cloak rolled in blood, shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire” (Isaiah 9:4), indicating that every <i>sa’on</i>, which <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi interprets as a small <i>se’a</i>, is “stamped with fierceness” and doesn’t go unpunished.",
      "<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that each and every <i>peruta</i> combine</b> to add up <b>to a great sum,</b> alluding to the notion that even if one is not immediately punished for a small transgression, in the final accounting all misdeeds will combine together and be addressed by the imposition of a large punishment? <b>The verse states:</b> “Behold, this have I found, says Koheleth, <b>adding one thing to another, to find out the account”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:27).",
      "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And we found this with regard to a <i>sota</i>, that with the measure with which she measured, she is measured with it: She stood by the opening of her house to exhibit herself to</b> her paramour, <b>therefore a priest has her stand at the Gate of Nicanor and exhibits her disgrace to all; she spread beautiful shawls [<i>sudarin</i>] on her head for</b> her paramour, <b>therefore a priest removes</b> her <b>kerchief from her head and places it under her feet; she adorned her face for</b> her paramour, <b>therefore</b>"

The adulterer acts in the twilight of the night to act in secrecy, and therefore God, Who is concealed, arranges that the matter is revealed in public.",
        "<b>Alternatively, she acted in secret,</b> and therefore <b>the Omnipresent revealed it in the open, as it is stated: “Though his hatred be concealed with deceit, his wickedness shall be revealed before the congregation”</b> (Proverbs 26:26), i.e., concealed acts of sin are ultimately revealed in public.",
        "§ The Gemara questions the need for two verses to indicate that small transgressions are addressed through one significant punishment. <b>And since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> that small transgressions are combined and punished together <b>from:</b> “Behold, this have I found, says Koheleth, <b>adding one thing to another, to find out the account”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:27), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“For every boot stamped with fierceness”</b> (Isaiah 9:4)? The Gemara answers: This verse serves <b>to</b> teach that even small transgressions are punished <b>by the measure,</b> i.e., with a punishment appropriate to the transgression.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And since he derives it from “for every boot stamped with fierceness,” why do I</b> need <b>“in full measure, when you send her away, you contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8)?",
        "The Gemara answers: This verse serves <b>to</b> teach the statement <b>as</b> taught <b>by Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa, for Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish a nation</b> deserving of punishment <b>until its time to be banished,</b> i.e., until the time of its final eradication from the world, <b>as it is stated: “In full measure, when you send her away,</b> you contend with her” (Isaiah 27:8).",
        "<b>Is that so? But didn’t Rava say: Why</b> are there specifically <b>three cups</b> of misfortune <b>that are stated with regard to Egypt</b> in the dream of its chief butler (see Genesis 40:11–13)? They are an allusion to three cups of misfortune that would later befall Egypt: <b>One that it drank in the days of Moses</b> during the ten plagues and the Exodus; <b>one that it drank in the days of Pharaoh Neco,</b> the king of Egypt who was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar; <b>and one that it will drink in the future with its companions,</b> i.e., the other nations, when they are punished during the days of the Messiah. This indicates that nations can be punished several times, not only when they are eradicated.",
        "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>those</b> ancient Egyptians, <b>have gone, and these</b> later Egyptians <b>are different ones, but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 4:3): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Minyamin, an Egyptian convert, was a friend of mine from among the students of Rabbi Akiva,</b> and <b>Minyamin the Egyptian convert said:</b> After I converted <b>I</b> was <b>a first-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert, <b>and</b> so <b>I married</b> another <b>first-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert. <b>I will marry off my son,</b> who is <b>a second-</b>generation Egyptian convert, <b>to</b> another <b>second-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert, <b>in order that my son’s son will be permitted to enter into the congregation.</b> The Torah prohibits Egyptian converts before the third generation to enter into the congregation (see Deuteronomy 23:8–9). By Minyamin’s observance of this prohibition even during the time of Rabbi Akiva, it indicates that Egypt during the tannaitic period was still viewed as biblical Egypt.",
        "<b>Rather, if</b> anything <b>was stated</b> with regard to the delay of punishment, it <b>was stated like this: Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish</b> a sinful <b>king until his time to be banished, as it is stated: “In full measure, when you send her away, you contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8).",
        "<b>Ameimar teaches that</b> statement <b>of Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa with regard to this: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For I the Lord change not; and you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed”</b> (Malachi 3:6)? <b>“For I the Lord change [<i>shaniti</i>] not”</b> is interpreted to mean: <b>I did not strike a nation and repeat [<i>shaniti</i>]</b> striking <b>it,</b> as a stricken nation never recovers from the initial strike. <b>“And you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed,”</b> is interpreted to mean: Despite the fact that I strike you many times for your sins, I do not let you perish. <b>This is</b> the same <b>as that which is written:</b> “I will heap evils upon them; <b>I will consume My arrows upon them”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:23), which is interpreted to mean: <b>My arrows are consumed</b> and used up, <b>and they,</b> the Jewish people, <b>are not consumed</b> but will continue to endure despite the many calamities that will befall them.",
        "<b>Rav Hamnuna says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish a person until his <i>se’a</i>,</b> the measure that is suitable for him, <b>is filled, as it is stated: “In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits;</b> the hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him” (Job 20:22). In other words, when the sufficient measure of sin has been reached, then the trouble will overtake him.",
        "Having mentioned Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa, the Gemara quotes another of his interpretations. <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous, praise is comely for the upright [<i>nava tehilla</i>]”</b> (Psalms 33:1)? <b>Do not read</b> the conclusion of the verse as: <b>Praise is comely [<i>nava</i>]; rather,</b> read it as: <b>A house [<i>naveh</i>] of praise. This</b> is referring to <b>Moses and David, whose enemies did not rule over their achievements,</b> as they each built a <i>naveh</i>, a house for the Lord, and this house remained in existence.",
        "With regard to <b>David,</b> the citadel that housed his home and city, was not destroyed, <b>as it is written: “Her gates are sunk into the ground”</b> (Lamentations 2:9), as the gates of Jerusalem built by David were not destroyed by enemies, but sunk into the ground and were buried there. This is also so with regard to <b>Moses, as the Master said: When the first Temple was built, the Tent of Meeting was sequestered,</b> including <b>its boards, its clasps, and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> is it sequestered? <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Avimi says: Beneath the tunnels of the Sanctuary.</b>",
        "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (4:16–19): The <b><i>sota</i> placed her eyes,</b> fixed her gaze, <b>on one who is unfit for her,</b> i.e., another man, so this is her punishment: <b>That which she desired,</b> i.e., to be with her paramour, <b>is not given to her,</b> as she becomes forbidden to him forever. <b>And that which she had,</b> i.e., her husband, <b>was taken away from her,</b> as she is now forbidden to him as well. This teaches <b>that anyone who places his eyes on that which is not his is not given what he desires, and that which he had is taken from him.</b>"
      ],
      [
        "<b>And, so too, we found with regard to the primeval snake</b> who seduced Eve, <b>for he placed his eyes on that which was unfit for him,</b> as he wanted to marry Eve. Consequently, <b>that which he desired was not given to him, and that which was in his possession was taken from him. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I</b> initially <b>said</b> that the snake <b>will be king over every domesticated animal and non-domesticated animal, but now he is cursed more than all the domesticated animals and all the non-domesticated animals of the field,</b> as it is stated: “And the Lord God said unto the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life” (Genesis 3:14).",
        "The <i>baraita</i> explains the elements of this curse. <b>I said</b> that the snake <b>will walk upright,</b> but <b>now he shall go on his belly; I said</b> that <b>his food will be</b> the same as the <b>food</b> eaten by <b>a person,</b> but <b>now he shall eat dust.</b> The snake <b>said: I will kill Adam and marry Eve,</b> but <b>now: “I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed”</b> (Genesis 3:15).",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And so we found with regard to Cain,</b> who desired to inherit the whole world alone (see Genesis 4); <b>and Korah,</b> who desired the priesthood (see Numbers 16); <b>and Balaam,</b> who desired Balak’s money (see Numbers 22); <b>and Doeg,</b> who was jealous of David (see I Samuel 21–22); <b>and Ahithophel,</b> who was also jealous of David (see II Samuel 16); <b>and Gehazi,</b> who took Naaman’s money (see II Kings 5); <b>and Absalom,</b> who wanted the kingdom (see II Samuel 15); <b>and Adonijah,</b> who also wanted the kingdom (see I Kings 1); <b>and Uzziah,</b> who wanted to be the High Priest (see II Chronicles 26); <b>and Haman,</b> who wanted to kill all the Jews (see Esther 3:13). All of these were people <b>who placed their eyes on that which is unfit for them, and</b> consequently <b>what they desired was not given to them, and what they had was taken from them.</b>",
        "§ The mishna teaches: <b>She began her transgression with</b> her <b>thigh</b> and afterward with her stomach, therefore the thigh is smitten first and then the stomach. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, i.e., that this is the order of her punishment? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written</b> in the verse detailing the priest’s curse: “Then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman: The Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people, <b>when the Lord does make your thigh to fall away, and your belly to swell”</b> (Numbers 5:21), which indicates the sequence of her punishment; <b>but isn’t</b> the opposite <b>written</b> in the verse describing what actually occurs to a guilty <i>sota</i>: <b>“And her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away”</b> (Numbers 5:27), indicating that the punishment begins with her stomach and then her thigh?",
        "<b>Abaye said</b> in explanation: <b>When</b> the priest <b>curses</b> the woman, <b>he first curses the thigh and then he curses the stomach, but when the</b> bitter <b>water evaluates</b> her, <b>it evaluates</b> her <b>along its way</b> through the body. The water <b>first</b> enters the <b>stomach and then</b> reaches the <b>thigh.</b> The Gemara asks: But <b>in</b> the verse detailing the <b>curse it is also written:</b> “And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels, <b>and will cause your belly to swell, and your thigh to fall away”</b> (Numbers 5:22). The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse teaches <b>that the priest notifies her that</b> the <b>stomach</b> will be affected <b>first and then</b> the <b>thigh, so that</b> one <b>not cast aspersions on the bitter water.</b>",
        "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna provides additional examples of people who were treated by Heaven commensurate with their actions. <b>Samson followed his eyes, therefore</b> he was punished measure for measure, as <b>the Philistines gouged out his eyes, as it is stated: “And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes”</b> (Judges 16:21).",
        "<b>Absalom was</b> excessively <b>proud of his hair,</b> and <b>therefore he was hanged by his hair. And</b> furthermore, <b>because he engaged in sexual intercourse with ten of his father’s concubines</b> (see II Samuel 15:16 and 16:22), <b>therefore ten spears [<i>loneviyyot</i>] were put,</b> i.e., thrust, <b>into him, as it is stated: “And ten young men that bore Joab’s armor compassed about</b> and smote Absalom, and slew him” (II Samuel 18:15). <b>And because he stole</b> three times, committing <b>three thefts</b> of people’s hearts: <b>The heart of his father,</b> as he tricked him by saying that he was going to sacrifice offerings; <b>the heart of the court,</b> as he tricked them into following him; <b>and the heart of the Jewish people, as it is stated: “So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel”</b> (II Samuel 15:6), <b>therefore three spears were embedded into</b> his heart, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Then said Joab: I may not tarry like this with you. <b>And he took three spears in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,</b> while he was yet alive” (II Samuel 18:14).",
        "The mishna continues: <b>And the same</b> is so <b>with regard to the</b> reward of <b>good</b> deeds; a person is rewarded measure for measure. <b>Miriam waited for</b> the baby <b>Moses</b> for <b>one hour</b> at the shore of the Nile, <b>as it is stated: “And his sister stood afar off,</b> to know what would be done to him” (Exodus 2:4). <b>Therefore the Jewish people delayed</b> their travels in the desert for <b>seven days</b> to wait <b>for her</b> when she was smitten with leprosy, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Miriam was confined outside of the camp seven days; <b>and the people journeyed not until Miriam was brought in again”</b> (Numbers 12:15).",
        "<b>Joseph merited to bury his father,</b> resulting in a display of great honor to his father, <b>and there was none among his brothers greater than he</b> in importance, for he was viceroy of Egypt, <b>as it is stated: “And Joseph went up to bury his father;</b> and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the Elders of his house, and all the Elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. <b>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen;</b> and it was a very great company” (Genesis 50:7–9). <b>Who, to us,</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Joseph, as it was none</b> other than <b>Moses who involved</b> himself in transporting <b>his</b> coffin.",
        "<b>Moses merited</b> to be the only person involved <b>in</b> the transportation of <b>Joseph’s bones</b> to be buried in Eretz Yisrael, <b>and there was none among the Jewish people greater than he, as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19). <b>Who</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Moses, as no one involved himself in his</b> burial <b>other than the Omnipresent</b> Himself, <b>as it is stated: “And He buried him in the valley</b> in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor; and no man knows of his sepulcher unto this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). The mishna comments: <b>Not only with regard to Moses did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that God takes part in his burial, <b>but</b> also <b>with regard to all the righteous individuals, as it is stated: “Your righteousness shall go before you and the glory of the Lord shall gather you in”</b> (Isaiah 58:8).",
        "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:15): <b>Samson rebelled with his eyes, as it is stated:</b> “Then his father and his mother said to him: Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you go out to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? <b>And Samson said to his father: Get her for me; for she is pleasant in my eyes”</b> (Judges 14:3). <b>Therefore, the Philistines gouged out his eyes, as it is stated: “And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes”</b> (Judges 16:21).",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it written: “But his father and his mother knew not that it was from the Lord;</b> as he sought a subterfuge against the Philistines” (Judges 14:4), indicating that Samson’s searching for a Philistine wife was due to a Divine mission? The Gemara answers: Although God did plan the punishment of the Philistines, <b>in any event when he went, he followed his inclination</b> and did not act for the sake of Heaven.",
        "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (3:15): <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: His initial wrongdoing was in Gaza,</b> and <b>therefore he was smitten in Gaza.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>His initial wrongdoing was in Gaza, as it is written: “And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot,</b> and went in unto her” (Judges 16:1). <b>Therefore, he was smitten in Gaza, as it is written:</b> “And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; <b>and they brought him down to Gaza,</b> and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house” (Judges 16:21).",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> earlier: <b>“And Samson went down to Timnah,</b> and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines” (Judges 14:1), indicating that his initial wrongdoing was in Timnah? The <b>Gemara answers: In any event, his initial wrongdoing was in Gaza,</b> for at least he had married the woman in Timnah; in Gaza, Samson never wed the woman but only engaged in sexual intercourse with her.",
        "The Gemara continues its discussion of Samson. The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah”</b> (Judges 16:4). <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Even <b>if she had not been called</b> by the <b>name Delilah, it would have been fitting that she be called Delilah,</b> for <b>she weakened [<i>dildela</i>] his strength, she weakened his heart,</b> and <b>she weakened his deeds,</b> thereby decreasing his merits.",
        "The Gemara explains: <b>She weakened his strength, as it is written:</b> “And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man and had the seven locks of his head shaved off; and she began to afflict him, <b>and his strength went from him”</b> (Judges 16:19). <b>She weakened his heart, as it is written: “And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart,</b> she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying: Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart” (Judges 16:18). <b>She weakened his deeds,</b> thereby decreasing his merits, <b>as the Divine Presence left him, as it is written:</b> “And she said: The Philistines are upon you, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said: I will go out as at other times, and shake myself. <b>But he knew not that the Lord was departed from him”</b> (Judges 16:20).",
        "The verse states: <b>“And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart”</b> (Judges 16:18). The Gemara asks: <b>From where did she know</b> that this time he had told her the truth about the source of his strength, as he had lied about it previously? <b>Rabbi Ḥanin says</b> that <b>Rav says: Words of truth are recognizable,</b> and she felt that this time he was telling the truth. <b>Abaye says</b> differently: <b>She knew about</b> Samson being <b>a righteous individual, that he would not express the name of Heaven in vain. Once he said:</b> “And he told her all his heart, and said to her: There has not come a razor upon my head; for <b>I have been a nazirite unto God</b> from my mother’s womb” (Judges 16:17), <b>she said: Now he is certainly saying the truth.</b>",
        "The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him,</b> that his soul was vexed unto death” (Judges 16:16). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“and urged him”?</b> How did she do so? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of the school of Rabbi Ami says: At the moment</b> immediately before his <b>completion of</b> the act of <b>intercourse, she slipped away from beneath him.</b> By doing this, she urged him to reveal his secret.",
        "When the angel spoke to Samson’s mother, he said: <b>“Now therefore beware, I pray of you, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing”</b> (Judges 13:4). The Gemara asks, <b>what</b> is the meaning of <b>“any unclean thing”?</b> That term usually means non-kosher foods, but obviously she would not eat them anyway. <b>And</b> what’s <b>more, until now was she eating unclean things,</b> that she should have to be warned not to continue doing so? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of the school of Rabbi Ami says:</b> The angel was not referring to foods that are actually unclean, but rather <b>items that are forbidden to a nazirite.</b>",
        "After Samson smote one thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey, he called the place Lehi, and God miraculously granted him to drink, as he was dying of thirst. The verse states: <b>“But God cleaved the hollow place that is in Lehi,</b> and out of there came water; and when he had drunk, his spirit came back, and he revived” (Judges 15:19). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of the school of Rabbi Ami says: He desired something unclean,</b> as he was driven by lust to Philistine women. <b>Therefore,</b> the saving of <b>his life was dependent on something unclean,</b> the jawbone of a donkey.",
        "The verse states with regard to Samson: <b>“And the spirit of the Lord began [<i>vataḥel</i>]</b> to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol” (Judges 13:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The prophecy of Jacob our forefather</b> concerning the tribe of Dan <b>took effect [<i>ḥaleta</i>]</b> through Samson, a member of the tribe of Dan, <b>as it is written: “Dan shall be a serpent in the way,</b> a horned snake in the path, that bites the horse’s heels, so that his rider falls backward” (Genesis 49:17).",
        "The verse continues: <b>“To move him [<i>lefa’amo</i>] in Mahaneh Dan.” Rabbi Yitzḥak of the school of Rabbi Ami says:</b> This <b>teaches that the Divine Presence jangled before him,</b> inspiring him, <b>like a bell [<i>zog</i>],</b> as <b>it is written here: “To move him [<i>lefa’amo</i>] in Mahaneh Dan,” and it is written there</b> with regard to the clothing of the High Priest: <b>“A bell [<i>pa’amon</i>] and a pomegranate”</b> (Exodus 39:26).",
        "The verse concludes: <b>“Between Zorah and Eshtaol.” Rabbi Asi says: Zorah and Eshtaol were two large mountains, and Samson uprooted them and ground them one against the other.</b>",
        "Samson’s parents were told: “For behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a nazirite unto God from the womb; <b>and he shall begin to save Israel</b> out of the hand of the Philistines” (Judges 13:5). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b>"

      "<b>This</b> one, i.e., the deceased Joseph, <b>fulfilled all that is written in this.</b> Therefore, it is fitting that the two arks should lie side by side.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And if Moses had not dealt with</b> the burial of Joseph, <b>would the Jewish people not have dealt with it? But isn’t it written</b> that after Moses died: <b>“And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem”</b> (Joshua 24:32), which indicates that the Jewish people completed the burial of Joseph? <b>And furthermore, if the Jewish people had not dealt with</b> Joseph’s burial, <b>would his children not have dealt with it? But isn’t it written</b> in that same verse: <b>“And they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph,”</b> as Joseph was buried in Shechem, which was then given to his descendants? Therefore, the question arises: Why did Joseph’s descendants initially leave the task of his burial to the Jewish people and Moses?",
      "The Gemara answers: <b>They said: Leave</b> Joseph for others. <b>It is more of an honor for</b> Joseph to be buried <b>by the many than by the few,</b> and therefore it is better that the Jewish people be involved in the burial. <b>And furthermore, they said: Leave</b> Joseph for others. <b>It is more of an honor for</b> Joseph to be buried <b>by</b> one of <b>the great</b> men like Moses <b>than by lesser ones</b> like us.",
      "In the aforementioned verse it states: “And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, <b>they buried in Shechem,</b> in the parcel of ground that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money” (Joshua 24:32). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about Shechem</b> that they specifically chose to bury Joseph there? <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> that the Jewish people said: His brothers <b>kidnapped him from Shechem</b> (see Genesis 37:12–28), <b>and to Shechem we should return his lost</b> body.",
      "The Gemara comments: <b>The verses contradict each other,</b> as <b>it is written: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19), <b>and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up</b> out of Egypt” (Joshua 24:32). Who in fact took Joseph’s bones?",
      "<b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Anyone who performs a matter but does not complete it, and then another comes and completes it, the verse ascribes credit to the one who completed it as if he had</b> actually <b>performed</b> the entire act. Due to the fact that the children of Israel completed Joseph’s burial, the Torah ascribes them credit as if they had performed the entire act.",
      "<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> with regard to one who initiates performance of a mitzva but does not complete it when capable of doing so: <b>He is also demoted [<i>moridin</i>] from his</b> position of <b>greatness, as it is written: “And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down [<i>vayyered</i>]</b> from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah” (Genesis 38:1). Usage of the term “went down” indicates that the rest of Judah’s brothers had demoted him from his position of greatness because he began the process of saving Joseph, but he did not complete it.",
      "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The episode with regard to Judah also indicates that one who initiates performance of a mitzva but does not complete it will <b>also bury his wife and children</b> as Judah did, <b>as it is written: “And</b> in process of time <b>Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died”</b> (Genesis 38:12), <b>and it is written</b> further: “And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; <b>but Er and Onan died</b> in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 46:12).",
      "<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: For what</b> reason <b>was Joseph called: Bones,</b> even <b>during his lifetime,</b> as he had his brothers take an oath that “God will surely remember you, and you shall carry up my bones from here” (Genesis 50:25)? <b>Because he did not protest for the honor of his father, as</b> the brothers <b>said to</b> Joseph while unaware of his true identity: <b>“Your servant our father”</b> (Genesis 43:28, 44:31), <b>and</b> Joseph <b>said nothing to them</b> in protest that they referred to his father Jacob as Joseph’s servant.",
      "<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that this was said by <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: For what</b> reason <b>did Joseph predecease his brothers,</b> as is indicated from his requesting of them to take care of his burial needs? <b>Because</b> Joseph <b>acted authoritatively,</b> and such behavior can reduce one’s life span.",
      "After describing that Judah “went down” from his greatness, the Gemara discusses a similar term employed with regard to Joseph, as the verse states: <b>“And Joseph was brought down [<i>hurad</i>] to Egypt”</b> (Genesis 39:1). <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Do not read</b> the word as <b>“<i>hurad</i>,”</b> meaning that he was passively brought down, <b>but</b> rather read it as <b><i>horid</i>,</b> meaning: He, Joseph, brought down others, <b>as</b> Joseph <b>brought down the astrologers [<i>itztagninei</i>] of Pharaoh from their</b> position of <b>eminence</b> because he knew the interpretation of Pharaoh’s dreams when they did not.",
      "The continuation of that verse states: <b>“And Potiphar, an officer [<i>seris</i>] of Pharaoh’s,</b> the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, <b>bought him</b> from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there” (Genesis 39:1). <b>Rav says: He purchased</b> the handsome Joseph <b>for himself,</b> for the intended purpose of homosexual intercourse, but was unable to fulfill his desires, as the angel <b>Gabriel came and castrated</b> Potiphar <b>[<i>seireso</i>].</b> Then <b>Gabriel came</b> again <b>and</b> further <b>mutilated</b> him <b>[<i>fero</i>]</b> in the same part of his body. This is alluded to in the verses that write Potiphar’s name differently: <b>Initially, it is written “Potiphar”</b> (Genesis 39:1) <b>and in the end it is written “Potiphera”</b> (Genesis 41:45). The change in his name indicates that a part of himself was mutilated.",
      "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Who, to us,</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Moses,</b> as no one involved himself in his burial other than the Omnipresent Himself. The Gemara teaches: When Moses relates how God responded to him when denying his request to enter Eretz Yisrael, he states: <b>“And the Lord said to me: Let it suffice for you [<i>rav lakh</i>];</b> speak no more to Me of this matter” (Deuteronomy 3:26). <b>Rabbi Levi says:</b> Moses <b>proclaimed</b> to the Jewish people when rebuking them <b>with</b> the term <b>“<i>rav</i>,”</b> and therefore <b>it was proclaimed to him with</b> the term <b>“<i>rav</i>”</b> that he would not enter Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara explains: <b>He proclaimed with</b> the term <b>“<i>rav</i>”</b> when speaking with the congregation of Korah: <b>“You take too much upon you [<i>rav lakhem</i>],</b> you sons of Levi” (Numbers 16:7), and <b>it was proclaimed to him with</b> the term <b>“<i>rav</i>,”</b> as God denied his request and said: <b>“Let it suffice for you [<i>rav lakh</i>].”</b>",
      "<b>Alternatively:</b> God’s telling Moses <b>“<i>rav lakh</i>”</b> was intended to mean: <b>You</b> now <b>have a <i>rav</i>,</b> a master, <b>and who is it?</b> It is <b>Joshua,</b> who has been chosen to lead the Jewish people.",
      "<b>Alternatively:</b> God’s telling Moses <b>“<i>rav lakh</i>”</b> was intended to mean: You have a <i>rav</i>, i.e., God, Who says that you may not enter Eretz Yisrael. You must not importune Me anymore, <b>so that</b> people <b>should not say: How difficult is the Master and how obstinate is the student.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> was Moses punished <b>so much</b> in that he was not allowed to enter Eretz Yisrael, despite being so righteous? <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the reason is based on the common aphorism: <b>Based on the camel is the burden.</b> In other words, a person is judged in accordance with his stature, and therefore a righteous individual will be punished greatly due to any sins he committed.",
      "The verse relates what Moses said to the Jewish people at the end of his life: <b>“And he said to them: I am a hundred and twenty years old this day;</b> I can no longer go out and come in; and the Lord has said to me: You shall not go over this Jordan” (Deuteronomy 31:2). The wording is problematic, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> the term <b>“this day.”</b> Moses said it in order to indicate: On <b>this day, my days and years have been completed</b> to be precisely one hundred and twenty, in order <b>to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is written: “The number of your days I will fill”</b> (Exodus 23:26), indicating that the righteous will live out their years fully.",
      "The verse continues: <b>“I can no longer go out and come in”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“go out and come in”? If we say</b> it means literally that Moses was <b>actually</b> physically restricted from <b>going out and coming in, but isn’t it written: “And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died,</b> his eye was not dim, <b>nor his natural force abated”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:7), indicating that he was at full physical strength? <b>And it is written</b> further: <b>“And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:1). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There were twelve steps there</b> to ascend the mountain, <b>and Moses stepped over them</b> all in <b>one step,</b> also indicating that he was at full physical strength.",
      "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The verse means that he could no longer <b>go out and come in with words of Torah.</b> This <b>teaches that the gates of wisdom were closed off to him.</b>",
      "The verse discussing when Joshua was appointed to be the successor of Moses states: <b>“And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:14). A Sage <b>taught: That Sabbath</b> when Moses died <b>was</b> a day <b>of two pairs [<i>deyo zugei</i>],</b> i.e., two wise men, Moses and Joshua, serving together in one place. <b>Authority was taken from one and given to the other.</b>",
      "<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: If not for</b> an explicitly <b>written verse, one could not say</b> what is written with regard to the death and burial of Moses. <b>Where did Moses die? In the portion of Reuben, as it is written: “And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:1), <b>and</b> it is known from elsewhere that <b>Nebo is situated in the portion of Reuben, as it is written: “And the children of Reuben built</b> Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim, <b>and Nebo”</b> (Numbers 32:37–38).",
      "The name is also expounded: It is called <b>“Nebo [<i>Nevo</i>],” for three prophets [<i>nevi’im</i>] died there: Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam.</b>",
      "Rabbi Yehuda continues: <b>And where is Moses buried? In the portion of Gad, as it is written</b> in the blessing of Moses to the tribe of Gad: <b>“And he chose a first part for himself,</b> for there a portion of a ruler was reserved” (Deuteronomy 33:21), indicating that Moses, the ruler, is buried in the portion of Gad. <b>And how much is</b> the distance <b>from the portion of Reuben to the portion of Gad? Four <i>mil</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda asks: For <b>those four <i>mil</i></b> from Mount Nebo in the portion of Reuben to the burial place of Moses in the portion of Gad, <b>who transported him?</b>",
      "He answers: The contradiction between the two verses <b>teaches that Moses was lying in the wings of the Divine Presence,</b> as Moses was carried out by God Himself, <b>and the ministering angels were saying: “He executed the righteousness of the Lord, and His ordinances with Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:21). <b>And the Holy One, Blessed be He, was saying: “Who will rise up for Me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for Me against the workers of iniquity?”</b> (Psalms 94:16). In other words, God asked: Who will now defend the Jewish people against its accusers? The idea that God Himself transported Moses to his burial could not have been said if not for the proof from the resolution between the contradictory verses.",
      "<b>And Shmuel says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“Who is as the wise man and who knows the interpretation [<i>pesher</i>] of a matter?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1), referring to the greatness of Moses, who was able to forge compromises, <i>pesharim</i>, between God and the Jewish people. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“Wisdom, where can it be found?”</b> (Job 28:12). <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“And Moses,</b> the servant of God, <b>died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>Semalyon says</b> that God was saying: <b>And Moses, the great scribe of Israel, died there.</b>",
      "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says:</b> Over an area of <b>twelve <i>mil</i> by twelve <i>mil</i>, equivalent to the</b> size of the <b>camp of Israel, a Divine Voice proclaimed and said: And Moses, the great scribe of Israel, died. And some say: Moses did not</b> actually <b>die,</b> as <b>it is written here: “And</b> Moses, the servant of the Lord, <b>died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5), <b>and it is written there: “And he was there with the Lord</b> forty days and forty nights” (Exodus 34:28). <b>Just as there,</b> where it says: “And he was there with the Lord,” it means that <b>he was standing and serving</b> before God; <b>so too, here,</b> when it says: “And Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there,” it means that <b>he was standing and serving</b> before God.",
      "The verse describing the burial of Moses states: <b>“And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor;</b> and no man knows of his grave to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). <b>Rabbi Berekhya says:</b> This verse provides <b>a sign within a sign,</b> i.e., a very precise description of the location of his burial, <b>and even with this</b> the verse concludes: <b>“And no man knows of his grave</b> to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6).",

        "He explains: <b>Rather,</b> the meaning is <b>that one should follow the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> He provides several examples. <b>Just as He clothes the naked, as it is written: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you clothe the naked.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, visits the sick, as it is written</b> with regard to God’s appearing to Abraham following his circumcision: <b>“And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre”</b> (Genesis 18:1), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you visit the sick.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, consoles mourners, as it is written: “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son”</b> (Genesis 25:11), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you console mourners.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, buried the dead, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley</b> in the land of Moab” (Deuteronomy 34:6), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you bury the dead.</b>",

        "<b>Rabbi Samlai taught:</b> With regard to the <b>Torah, its beginning is an act of kindness and its end is an act of kindness.

        "<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: Do you seek</b> to enter the land to perform these mitzvot <b>for any</b> reason <b>other than to receive a reward?

        "Rabbi Samlai proceeds to expound the verse <b>“Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great”</b> to mean that he will receive reward.

        "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The husband of the <i>sota</i> <b>would bring</b> his wife’s <b>meal-offering</b> to the priest <b>in an Egyptian wicker basket</b> made of palm branches, <b>and he would place</b> the meal-offering <b>in her hands</b> for her to hold throughout the ritual <b>in order to fatigue her.</b> This might lead her to confess her guilt and not drink the water of a <i>sota</i> unnecessarily.",
        "The mishna lists differences between this meal-offering and other meal-offerings. Generally, <b>all meal-offerings,</b> from <b>their beginnings,</b> i.e., the moment they are consecrated, <b>and</b> until <b>their ends,</b> i.e., the moment they are sacrificed, must be <b>in a service vessel. But</b> in the case of <b>this one, its beginning is in a wicker basket and</b> only at <b>its end,</b> immediately before it is offered, is it placed <b>in a service vessel.</b>",
        "<b>All</b> other <b>meal-offerings require oil and frankincense, and this one requires neither oil nor frankincense.</b> Furthermore, <b>all</b> other <b>meal-offerings are brought from wheat, and this one is brought from barley. Although</b> in fact <b>the <i>omer</i> meal-offering</b> is also <b>brought from barley,</b> it is still different in that <b>it was brought as groats,</b> i.e., high-quality meal. The meal-offering of the <i>sota</i>, however, <b>is brought as</b> unsifted barley <b>flour. Rabban Gamliel says:</b> This hints that <b>just as her actions</b> of seclusion with another man <b>were the actions of an animal, so too her offering is animal food,</b> i.e., barley and not wheat.",
        "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Ḥanin says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: And why</b> is <b>so much</b> done to her? It is <b>in order to fatigue her, so that she will retract</b> and confess her guilt and be spared death. And <b>if the Torah is so protective of those who transgress His will,</b> i.e., the <i>sota</i>, who secluded herself with the man she was warned against, then by <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference He is protective <b>of those who do His will.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that they attempt to induce her to confess <b>because</b> the Torah <b>is protective</b> of the <i>sota</i>? <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>in order that the scroll</b> of the <i>sota</i>, containing the name of God, <b>will not be erased.</b> The Gemara responds: Rabbi Eliezer <b>holds</b>"
      ],
      [
        "that the priest would first <b>give</b> her the water of the <i>sota</i> <b>to drink, and</b> only <b>afterward</b> would he <b>sacrifice her meal-offering.</b> Therefore, <b>if</b> the concern were <b>due to the scroll,</b> it would no longer be applicable, as <b>it was</b> already <b>erased</b> in the water of the <i>sota</i> before the meal-offering was brought. The efforts to fatigue her by making her hold the meal-offering must indicate that the Torah is protective of her.",
        "It was taught in the mishna: <b>All meal-offerings,</b> from their beginning until their end, are placed in service vessels and remain there. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 1:16): <b>What is the procedure for meal-offerings? A person brings his meal-offering from his property in baskets [<i>kelatot</i>] of silver and of gold, and</b> when he reaches the Temple <b>he places it in a service vessel and sanctifies it in</b> the <b>service vessel, and he puts its oil and frankincense on it, and he carries it to the priest. And the priest</b> then <b>carries it to the altar and brings it near to the southwest horn</b> of the altar, <b>opposite the corner of the horn</b> of the altar. <b>And</b> this <b>is sufficient.</b>",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the priest then <b>removes the frankincense to one side, and he removes a handful from the place where its oil has accumulated</b> and mixed with the flour, <b>and he puts</b> the handful <b>into a service vessel and consecrates it in</b> the <b>service vessel. And he</b> then <b>gathers its frankincense and puts it on top of</b> the handful <b>and brings it up onto the altar. And he brings it up and burns it in</b> the <b>service vessel; and he salts it and places it upon the fires.</b>",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: After <b>the handful is sacrificed, the remainders of</b> the meal-offering <b>are eaten. And the priests are permitted to put wine and oil and honey in it,</b> even though it is prohibited to offer honey on the altar. <b>And they are prohibited only from allowing</b> the meal-offering <b>to become leavened.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the meal-offering is first placed <b>in baskets of silver and baskets of gold</b> brought from one’s home. This seems to contradict the mishna’s statement that all other meal-offerings are initially in service vessels. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The mishna means to <b>say</b> that meal-offerings are placed <b>in vessels</b> of silver and gold, as <b>these are suitable to be service vessels</b> if consecrated.",
        "The Gemara notes: Since the mishna distinguishes in this regard between the meal-offering of the <i>sota</i> and all other meal-offerings, one may learn <b>by inference that an Egyptian wicker basket is not suitable</b> to be a service vessel even if it is consecrated. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this the case? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>service vessels that were made of wood, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems them unfit, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems them fit.</b>",
        "The Gemara responds: <b>You</b> can <b>even say that</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. Say that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> that wooden vessels are deemed fit <b>with regard to</b> those of <b>superior</b> quality; but <b>does he say</b> likewise <b>with regard to</b> vessels of <b>lesser</b> quality, e.g., a basket made of palm branches? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, hold</b> to the principle articulated in the verse: “And when you offer the blind for a sacrifice, is it not evil! …If you would <b>present it now unto your governor,</b> will he be pleased with you or show you favor?” (Malachi 1:8)? Nothing that is unfit for presentation to a ruler may be brought to the Temple. Therefore, even Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, must agree that a basket made of palm branches cannot be a service vessel.",
        "§ The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>He places it in a service vessel and sanctifies it in</b> the <b>service vessel.</b> The Gemara asks: Can one <b>learn from</b> the unnecessary repetition of the term service vessel, that <b>service vessels can sanctify</b> their contents <b>only with intention?</b> Must one place the meal-offering in the service vessel with express intent to sanctify it? The Gemara answers: <b>Say: He</b> simply <b>places it in the service vessel</b> in order <b>to sanctify it in the service vessel.</b> He need not intend to sanctify it.",
        "§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The owner of the meal-offering <b>puts its oil and frankincense on it.</b> The Gemara cites the source of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>As it is stated:</b> “And when anyone brings a meal-offering unto the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; <b>and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon”</b> (Leviticus 2:1).",
        "The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And he carries it to the priest.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons,</b> the priests” (Leviticus 2:2).",
        "The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And the priest</b> then <b>carries it to the altar.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written:</b> “And you shall bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the Lord; and it shall be presented unto the priest, <b>and he shall bring it unto the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8).",
        "The <i>baraita</i> states: The priest <b>brings it near to the southwest horn</b> of the altar, <b>opposite the corner of the horn. And</b> this <b>is sufficient.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this?",
        "The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written: “And this is the law of the meal-offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord in front of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:7). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“Before the Lord,”</b> one <b>might</b> have understood this to mean <b>on the western side</b> of the altar, opposite the Holy of Holies. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In front of the altar.”</b> This must be the south of the altar, where the ramp is located. <b>If</b> the verse had stated only: <b>In front of the altar,</b> one <b>might</b> have understood it to mean specifically <b>on the southern side.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Before the Lord,”</b> indicating the western side. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The priest <b>brings it near to the southwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>opposite the corner of the horn. And</b> this <b>is sufficient.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> another interpretation: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he offers it up on the western side of the corner or on the southern side of the corner. Say: Anywhere you find two verses, one</b> of which <b>fulfills itself and fulfills the statement of the other, and one</b> of which <b>fulfills itself and nullifies the statement of the other, leave</b> the verse <b>that fulfills itself and nullifies the other, and seize the one that fulfills itself and fulfills the other.</b> The principle is applied as follows: <b>When you say: “Before the Lord,” on the western side, you have nullified</b> the other part of the verse: <b>“In front of the altar,” on the southern side. But when you say: “In front of the altar,” on the southern side, you have</b> also <b>fulfilled: “Before the Lord,” on the western side. How so? He brings it near to the southern side of the corner.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But where have you fulfilled</b> the phrase “before the Lord”? <b>Rav Ashi said: This <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>the entire altar stands in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. Therefore, the entire southern side of the altar stood opposite the Holy of Holies in the west, and it can therefore be called: Before the Lord.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is taught by the phrase: <b>And</b> this <b>is sufficient? Rav Ashi said:</b> This phrase <b>was necessary,</b> as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say: Require</b> the priest <b>to bring the meal-offering itself near</b> to the corner of the altar without the use of a vessel. The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, and one can bring it to the altar in its service vessel.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that this is <b>indeed</b> so? The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the Lord; <b>and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8); <b>just as presentation to the priest is in a vessel, so too bringing</b> it <b>to the altar</b> must be <b>in a vessel.</b>",
        "The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And he removes its frankincense to one side.</b> The Gemara explains: This is done <b>in order that</b> the frankincense <b>not be removed along with the meal-offering</b> when the priest removes a handful. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 6a): If he <b>removed</b> the <b>handful and a pebble, or a grain of salt, or a crumb [<i>koret</i>] of frankincense came out in his hand, it is invalid.</b> The handful must be entirely fine flour.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he removes a handful from the place where its oil has accumulated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall take from there his handful <b>of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The Torah also states: “And the priest shall make the memorial part of it smoke, even <b>of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof”</b> (Leviticus 2:16). The handful should be taken from the area where there is an abundance of oil.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he puts</b> the handful <b>into a service vessel and sanctifies it in</b> the <b>service vessel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need this sanctification? <b>He has</b> already <b>sanctified it once,</b> when he initially brought it to the Temple. The Gemara responds: The sanctification here is <b>just as with</b> the <b>blood</b> of the offerings. <b>Although the knife sanctifies blood</b> by contact with <b>the neck of the animal,</b> since the knife itself is a service vessel, the priest <b>sanctifies it again</b> when he collects it <b>in the service vessel. Here too, it is not different;</b> the meal-offering must be sanctified twice.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he gathers its frankincense and puts it on top of</b> the handful. The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall take up from his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, <b>and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8).",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he</b> then <b>brings it up</b>"

      "<b>Shiloh, Nob, and Gibeon, and</b> also <b>the Eternal House,</b> i.e., the Temple in Jerusalem. The dust for the <i>sota</i> is still brought from the ground of the Sanctuary wherever it is located, even after the Jewish people are no longer in the wilderness.",
      "<b>Isi ben Menaḥem says: There is no need</b> to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the verse. It may be learned by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>With regard to</b> the prohibition against entering the Sanctuary in a state of <b>impurity, a lenient</b> matter for which there is no court-imposed capital punishment, <b>the Torah does not differentiate.</b> It is prohibited for an impure person to enter the Tabernacle no matter where it stands. Therefore, <b>with regard to the impurity of a married woman,</b> which is <b>stringent</b> and carries the penalty of strangulation, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that the Torah does not differentiate? The dust must be brought from the Sanctuary no matter where it stands. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And of the dust that is <b>on the floor of the Tabernacle”?</b> It teaches <b>that one should not bring</b> dust <b>from his</b> own <b>basket</b> and place it directly into the water; he must first place it on the floor.",
      "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>there is no dust there, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May one <b>place ashes</b> in the vessel instead? The Gemara responds: There is <b>no</b> need to <b>raise the dilemma</b> if one holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, as they say: We never find ashes referred to as dust</b> in the Torah.",
      "<b>When you raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, who say: We</b> do <b>find ashes referred to as dust</b> in the context of the red heifer (Numbers 19:17). They likewise hold that ashes may also be used instead of dust to cover the blood of a slaughtered bird or undomesticated animal (see Leviticus 17:13). <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> here, with regard to the water of a <i>sota</i>? May ashes replace dust? <b>Although</b> elsewhere ashes may be <b>referred to as dust, here it is written: “On the floor of the Tabernacle,”</b> indicating that dust in particular is required, since dust comes from the ground. <b>Or perhaps</b> the phrase <b>“on the floor of the Tabernacle” comes</b> only to teach that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the teaching of <b>Isi ben Yehuda or in accordance with</b> the teaching of <b>Isi ben Menaḥem.</b> If so, perhaps ashes are acceptable as well.",
      "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> evidence from <b>that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: In three instances the <i>halakha</i> supersedes the verse,</b> i.e., the tradition alters the straightforward meaning of the verse.",
      "<b>The Torah states:</b> “And whatsoever man…that takes in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it <b>in dust”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the blood may be covered <b>in anything</b> similar to dust. <b>The Torah states</b> with regard to the nazirite: “All the days of his vow of naziriteship there shall be no <b>razor</b> come upon his head” (Numbers 6:5), <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the nazirite may not remove his hair <b>with anything. The Torah states:</b> “That he writes her a <b>bill [<i>sefer</i>]</b> of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:1). The word <i>sefer</i> denotes a scroll, <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the husband may inscribe the bill of divorce <b>on anything</b> that is detached from the ground and suitable to be written upon, not only on a scroll.",
      "<b>And if it is so</b> that ashes may be placed in the water of a <i>sota</i> despite the verse’s stipulation of dust, <b>consider this</b> fourth case <b>as well</b> to be a <i>halakha</i> that supersedes the verse. Since it is omitted from Rabbi Yishmael’s statement, it seems that ashes may not be used.",
      "The Gemara responds: Rabbi Yishmael <b>taught</b> some cases <b>and omitted</b> others; his list is not exhaustive. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> else <b>did he omit that he omitted this?</b> It is not reasonable that he would provide a list lacking only one item. The Gemara answers: <b>He omitted the leper, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nega’im</i> 1:9): In the verse: <b>“And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave off all his hair”</b> (Leviticus 14:9), the phrase “all his hair” is <b>a generalization.</b> The phrase that follows: <b>“His head and his beard and his eyebrows,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> And with the following phrase: <b>“Even all his hair he shall shave off,”</b> the verse <b>then generalized</b> again. In any case of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the detail is explicitly</b> referring to <b>areas</b> where there is <b>a collection of hair which is visible, so too all areas</b> on the leper that have <b>a collection of hair which is visible</b> must be shaven.",
      "To <b>what</b> otherwise excluded case does this <i>baraita</i> <b>extend</b> the <i>halakha</i>? It <b>extends</b> the <i>halakha</i> of hair to include <b>pubic hair. What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>exclude? It excludes armpit hair,</b> which is not visible, <b>and body hair</b> that is not collected. This is the straightforward meaning of the verse.",
      "<b>And</b> yet <b>the <i>halakha</i> is:</b> The leper <b>shaves like a gourd,</b> i.e., his entire body must be shaved. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:2): When the priest <b>comes to shave the leper, he passes a razor over all of his flesh. And</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> the mishna <b>teaches: On the seventh day he shaves</b> the leper again. <b>The second shaving is</b> just <b>like the first shaving.</b> The verse previously analyzed is referring to the second shaving, and its straightforward meaning is that not all of the leper’s flesh needs to be shaved. However, the mishna states that the leper must shave all of his flesh in the second shaving as well. This is another instance where the <i>halakha</i> supersedes the straightforward meaning of the verse, yet it is omitted from Rabbi Yishmael’s list.",
      "<b>Rabbi Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Rabbi Yishmael consciously omitted the <i>halakha</i> of the leper because he <b>counted</b> only instances where the <b><i>halakha</i> supersedes</b> the straightforward meaning of the <b>verse. This</b> <i>halakha</i> of the leper, however, <b>is</b> an instance where the <i>halakha</i> <b>supersedes</b> only an exegetical interpretation <b>of the Sages.</b>",
      "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>counted</b> only cases where the <b><i>halakha</i></b> both <b>supersedes and uproots</b> the straightforward meaning of the verse. <b>This,</b> however, is an instance where the <i>halakha</i> <b>supersedes and adds.</b> The <i>halakha</i> does not overrule the verse but rather adds an additional requirement, i.e., that the whole body must be shaved.",
      "<b>Rav Ashi said: This <i>baraita</i>,</b> which teaches that only certain parts of the body must be shaved, <b>is</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who interprets</b> verses by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b> According to this interpretation, only collected areas of hair that are visible must be shaven."

      "<b>Rava said: This</b> phrase: <b>“For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread,”</b> is not how the verse would present this idea. <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>“On account of a loaf a man is brought to a harlot.” Rather, Rava says</b> the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse with a harlot</b> will <b>eventually</b> be reduced to poverty and <b>beg</b> people for <b>a loaf of bread.</b>",
      "The Gemara continues its discussion of washing hands. <b>Rabbi Zerika says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Anyone who treats</b> the ritual of <b>washing hands with contempt is uprooted from the world. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to the <b>first water,</b> i.e., the water used when washing one’s hands before a meal, one <b>must raise his hands upward</b> after washing. With regard to the <b>last water,</b> i.e., the water used when washing one’s hands at the conclusion of the meal before reciting Grace after Meals, one <b>must lower his hands downward. This</b> distinction <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Yadayim</i> 2:2): <b>One who washes his hands</b> before a meal <b>must raise his hands upward</b> after washing, <b>lest the water advance past the joint</b> onto the part of the hands that he was not required to wash, becoming impure, <b>and</b> then <b>return</b> to the area he had washed, <b>rendering</b> his <b>hands ritually impure.</b>",
      "<b>Rabbi Abbahu says: Anyone who eats bread without wiping</b> his <b>hands</b> dry after washing them causes the bread to become repulsive and is considered <b>as if he were eating impure bread,</b> since the verse refers to repulsive bread as impure bread, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord said: Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean</b> among the nations where I will drive them” (Ezekiel 4:13). Eating bread with wet hands causes the bread to become repulsive. The verse deems eating in an uncouth manner, as did the gentiles among whom the Jewish people were exiled, as akin to eating ritually impure bread.",
      "§ The Gemara now continues the interpretation of the above quoted verse: “For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread” (Proverbs 6:26). The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the continuation of the verse: <b>“But the adulteress hunts for the precious life”? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any person who has arrogance within him will eventually stumble</b> by sinning <b>with an adulteress, as it is stated: “But the adulteress hunts for the precious life,”</b> i.e., she sins with one who considers himself precious.",
      "<b>Rava said: This</b> phrase: <b>“The precious life,”</b> is not how the verse would present this idea. <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>An arrogant life. And further, it should have</b> stated: A precious life, <b>she hunts</b> for the adulteress, indicating that the precious soul will entrap the adulteress, and not vice versa, as the verse indicates as written. <b>Rather, Rava says</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse with an adulteress, even</b> if that man <b>studied Torah, about which it is written: “She is more precious than rubies [<i>peninim</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 3:15), which, based on its etymological connection with the Hebrew term for the Holy of Holies, <i>lifnai velifnim</i>, is interpreted by the Sages to mean that one who studies Torah is more precious <b>than a High Priest, who enters the innermost sanctum,</b> still, <b>this</b> transgression of adultery <b>will entrap him into the judgment of Gehenna,</b> and the Torah he studied will not be able to save him.",
      "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Any person who has arrogance within him</b> is considered <b>as if he were an idol worshipper,</b> as <b>it is written here: “Everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 16:5), <b>and it is written there</b> concerning the destruction of idols: <b>“And you shall not bring an abomination into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26).",
      "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said his own</b> statement: Any person who has arrogance within him is considered <b>as if he has denied the core</b> belief in God’s existence, <b>as it is stated: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:14).",
      "<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says:</b> Any person who has arrogance within him is considered <b>as if he engaged in sexual intercourse with all</b> of <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> as <b>it is written here: “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 16:5), <b>and it is written there,</b> at the end of the passage concerning forbidden sexual relationships: <b>“For all these abominations</b> have the men of the land done” (Leviticus 18:27).",
      "<b>Ulla says:</b> Any person who has arrogance within him is considered <b>as if he built</b> a personal <b>altar</b> for idol worship, <b>as it is stated: “Cease you from man, in whose nostrils there is breath, for how little [<i>bammeh</i>] is he to be accounted”</b> (Isaiah 2:22), referring to an arrogant person. <b>Do not read</b> the verse <b>as</b> it is written, <b><i>bammeh</i>,</b> how little. <b>Rather,</b> read it as <b><i>bama</i>,</b> altar.",
      "Having interpreted the phrase: “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord” (Proverbs 16:5), the Gemara interprets the continuation of the verse. <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Hand to hand, he shall not be unpunished”</b> (Proverbs 16:5)? <b>Rav says: Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse with an adulteress, even</b> if <b>he</b> were to have <b>attributed possession of heaven and earth to the Holy One, Blessed be He, just as Abraham our forefather</b> did, <b>that it is written with regard to him: “I have lifted up my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth”</b> (Genesis 14:22), <b>he will not be unpunished from the judgment of Gehenna.</b> Abraham is described as one whose hands were lifted to declare the glory of God, yet this verse declares that even if one who engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse were to use his hands in the same way, still, due to his sin, the verse says: “He shall not be unpunished.”",
      "This interpretation <b>poses a difficulty to</b> the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Sheila: This</b> phrase: <b>“Hand to hand, he shall not be unpunished,”</b> is not how the verse would present this idea. <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>My hand,</b> as that is the term employed in the verse with regard to Abraham.",
      "<b>Rather,</b> the Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Sheila say:</b> This teaches that <b>even</b> if one who engages in sexual intercourse with an adulteress had <b>received the Torah</b> from the hand of God <b>like Moses our teacher</b> did, <b>that it is written with regard to him: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), i.e., God gave the Torah from His right hand into the hand of Moses in order to give to the Jewish people, the sinner <b>will not be unpunished from the judgment of Gehenna.</b>",
      "<b>This</b> interpretation also <b>poses a difficulty to Rabbi Yoḥanan: This</b> phrase “<b>hand to hand”</b> is not how the verse would present this idea. <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>Hand from hand,</b> as that is the term employed in the verse with regard to Moses.",
      "<b>Rather Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b>"

Rather, the question is as follows: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the waving is performed <b>by the owner,</b> i.e., the woman, and not only by the priest?",

Yet the continuation of the mishna states: The priest <b>would force</b> the woman <b>to drink, and afterward he would sacrifice her meal-offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t</b> the mishna state in the previous phrase that the offering <b>was</b> already <b>sacrificed?</b>",

The <i>baraita</i> answers: The repetition teaches <b>that if the scroll was</b> already <b>erased and</b> then the woman <b>says: I will not drink, she is forced [<i>me’arerin</i>] to drink against her will.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Shimon says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial part of it, and burn it upon the altar, <b>and afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink</b> the water” (Numbers 5:26)? <b>But isn’t it already stated</b> previously: <b>“And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink”</b> (Numbers 5:24)? <b>Rather,</b> this verse indicates that the <i>sota</i> is given the bitter water to drink only <b>after all the actions that are stated above</b> are performed, i.e., erasing the scroll, sacrificing the meal-offering, and administering the oath. Therefore, this verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>three matters preclude her</b> from drinking: She does not drink <b>until the handful is sacrificed, and until the scroll is erased, and until she accepts the oath upon herself.</b>",
        "The Gemara elaborates: She does not drink <b>until the handful is sacrificed. Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> stated earlier, <b>as he says</b> that the priest <b>sacrifices her meal-offering and afterward forces her to drink.</b>",
        "The Gemara questions the second condition: She does not drink <b>until the scroll is erased.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> need to state this? <b>But what</b> could <b>he give her to drink</b> if the scroll was not yet erased into the water? <b>Rav Ashi says: No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary for</b> an instance <b>where</b> the scroll was erased, but <b>the impression</b> of the ink <b>is</b> still <b>discernible</b> on the parchment. The woman does not drink until the scroll is totally erased.",
        "The Gemara discusses the third condition: She does not drink <b>until she accepts the oath upon herself.</b> One might infer from this statement that <b>it is</b> only <b>that</b> she <b>does not drink</b> before she accepts the oath; <b>however,</b> the scroll <b>is written for her</b> before she accepts the oath. <b>But didn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>a scroll of a <i>sota</i> that was written before she accepted the oath upon herself,</b> whoever wrote it <b>did nothing,</b> and the scroll is rendered invalid. The Gemara responds: <b>This was cited for no reason,</b> as in fact the scroll is not even written before she accepts the oath upon herself, and nothing should be inferred.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree</b> in the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>Three verses are written</b> which pertain to drinking the bitter water: <b>The first</b> occurrence of the term is in the verse: <b>“And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink”</b> (Numbers 5:24); the second: <b>“And afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink</b> the water” (Numbers 5:26); and <b>the last</b> occurrence of the term is in the verse: <b>“And he shall make her drink”</b> (Numbers 5:27).",
        "<b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the first</b> occurrence of the term: <b>“And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink,”</b> is written <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> the priest first <b>forces her to drink and afterward sacrifices her meal-offering.</b> The second instance: <b>“And afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink,” is necessary</b> to teach <b>that</b> as long as <b>the impression</b> of the writing <b>is</b> still <b>discernible,</b> the <i>sota</i> is not given the bitter water to drink. The third verse, <b>the last</b> occurrence of the term: <b>“And he shall make her drink,”</b> teaches <b>that if the scroll was erased and</b> then the woman <b>says: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will.</b>",
        "<b>And Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the second verse: <b>“And afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink</b> the water” (Numbers 5:26), is written <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> the priest first <b>sacrifices her meal-offering and afterward forces her to drink. The first</b> occurrence of the term: <b>“And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink,”</b> teaches <b>that if he forced her to drink and</b> only <b>afterward sacrificed her meal-offering,</b> the offering <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>valid. The last</b> occurrence of the term: <b>“And he shall make her drink,”</b> teaches <b>that if</b> the <b>scroll was erased and</b> then <b>she said: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will.</b>",
        "The Gemara explains the Rabbis’ opinion: <b>And the Rabbis</b> would respond to Rabbi Shimon that the <b>verse does not begin</b> the discussion <b>with</b> a <i>halakha</i> that is applicable only <b>after the fact,</b> and therefore the initial mention of the drinking is referring to the proper time for the ritual.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Akiva</b> in fact <b>hold</b> that the woman is <b>forced to drink against her will? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A hook [<i>kelabus</i>]</b> made <b>of iron is</b> forcibly <b>placed into her mouth,</b> so <b>that if the scroll was erased and she said: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will. Rabbi Akiva said:</b> It is not necessary to force her to drink. <b>Don’t we need</b> to force her to drink the water <b>only</b> in order <b>to evaluate her</b> fidelity? <b>And isn’t she established as</b> having been <b>evaluated</b> when she refuses to drink, as she is essentially admitting her guilt? <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Akiva’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>Until the handful is sacrificed she can retract</b> her decision to drink the bitter water; however, <b>once the handful is sacrificed she cannot retract</b> her decision to drink.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But according to your reasoning</b> in explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s statement, <b>this</b> explanation <b>itself should pose a difficulty for you.</b> Why <b>can’t she retract</b> her decision <b>once the handful is sacrificed? And isn’t she established as</b> having been <b>evaluated</b> when she refuses to drink?",
        "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> case, where she is forced to drink, is referring to a situation <b>where she retracts</b> her decision to drink <b>due to fear,</b> as her refusal is not viewed as an admission of guilt, and it is possible that if she drinks she will be found undefiled. <b>And that</b> case, where she does not drink, is referring to a situation <b>where she retracts</b> her decision <b>in a state of</b> good <b>health.</b> Since she does not appear to be afraid, her refusal is viewed as an admission of guilt.",
        "<b>And this is what</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>is saying:</b> In <b>any</b> case where she retracts her decision to drink <b>in a state of</b> good <b>health, she does not drink at all.</b> With regard to a <i>sota</i> who retracts her decision <b>due to fear,</b> if she retracts her decision <b>before the handful is sacrificed, when the scroll has not yet been erased; or</b> even if the <b>scroll was</b> already <b>erased,</b> since <b>the priests acted incorrectly when they erased</b> it beforehand; <b>she can retract</b> her decision. <b>Once the handful is sacrificed, in which</b> case the <b>priests acted correctly when they erased</b> the scroll, <b>she cannot retract</b> her decision, and she is forced to drink against her will."
      ],
      [
        "The Gemara asks: The statement <b>of Rabbi Akiva</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Akiva: There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>he said</b> that <b>erasure prevents</b> the authorities from compelling the woman to drink the water if she retracted her decision to drink, <b>and here he says</b> that the sacrifice of the <b>handful prevents</b> the authorities from compelling the woman to drink the water. In other words, according to the first <i>baraita</i> the woman can retract her decision to drink until the scroll is erased, whereas according to the second <i>baraita</i> she can retract her decision until the handful is sacrificed.",
        "The Gemara responds: There is a dispute between <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva.</b> They disagree with regard to what point in time, according to Rabbi Akiva, is the final moment at which a woman can refuse to drink the bitter water without being forced to do so.",
        "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>she</b> initially <b>said: I will not drink, while in a state of</b> good <b>health, and</b> then <b>she retracted</b> her statement <b>and said: I will drink, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>when she said: I will not drink,</b> it is as if <b>she</b> confessed and <b>said: I am defiled, and since she established herself as defiled she cannot retract</b> her statement? <b>Or perhaps when she said: I will drink, she revealed her thoughts that it</b> was only <b>due to fear that she said</b> she will not drink? The Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
        "<b>Shmuel’s father says:</b> It is <b>necessary</b> for one <b>to put a bitter</b> substance <b>into the water</b> that the <i>sota</i> drinks. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states:</b> “And he shall blot them out into <b>the water of bitterness”</b> (Numbers 5:23), indicating <b>that</b> they <b>are already bitter</b> before the scroll is erased.",
        "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>before the scroll was erased she said: I will not drink, the scroll</b> that was written for <b>her is sequestered, and her meal-offering is</b> burned and <b>scattered over</b> the place of <b>the ashes, and her scroll is not fit to give</b> to <b>another <i>sota</i> to drink.</b> If <b>the scroll was erased and</b> afterward <b>she said: I am defiled, the water is poured out, and her meal-offering is scattered in the place of the ashes.</b> If <b>the scroll was</b> already <b>erased and she said: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will.</b>",
        "When a guilty woman drinks <b>she does not manage to</b> finish <b>drinking before her face turns green and her eyes bulge, and her</b> skin becomes <b>full of</b> protruding <b>veins, and</b> the people standing in the Temple <b>say: Remove her,</b> so <b>that she does not render the Temple courtyard impure</b> by dying there.",
        "The mishna limits the scope of the previous statement: <b>If she has merit, it delays</b> punishment <b>for her</b> and she does not die immediately. <b>There is a merit</b> that <b>delays</b> punishment for <b>one year, there is</b> a larger <b>merit</b> that <b>delays</b> punishment for <b>two years,</b> and <b>there is a merit</b> that <b>delays</b> punishment for <b>three years.

        "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Meir: When I was studying Torah before Rabbi Akiva,</b> as his disciple, <b>I used to put iron sulfate into the ink</b> with which I wrote Torah scrolls, <b>and he did not say anything to me</b> in protest. Afterward, <b>when I came</b> to learn Torah <b>before Rabbi Yishmael, he said to me: My son, what is your vocation? I said to him: I am a scribe [<i>lavlar</i>]</b> who writes Torah scrolls. <b>He said to me: My son, be careful</b> in your work, <b>as your work is the work of Heaven, lest you omit a single letter</b> from the Torah scroll <b>or add a single letter,</b> and in this <b>you are found to be destroying the entire world</b> if the mistake alters the meaning of the verse and results in blasphemy.",
        "Rabbi Meir continues: <b>I said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: <b>I have one substance that I put into the ink, and it is called iron sulfate,</b> which prevents the writing from being erased. <b>He said to me: And may iron sulfate be put into the ink? The Torah</b> clearly <b>said</b> with regard to the scroll of the <i>sota</i>: “And the priest shall write these curses in a scroll, <b>and he shall blot</b> them out into the water of bitterness” (Numbers 5:23). This indicates that the Torah requires <b>writing that can be blotted out.</b>",
        "Since Rabbi Meir’s remark about iron sulfate seems unrelated to Rabbi Yishmael’s previous statement, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saying to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>and what is</b> Rabbi Meir <b>replying to</b> Rabbi Yishmael?",
        "The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Meir <b>is saying to him: It is not necessary</b> to say that I do not err <b>in omissions and additions, as I am an expert. Rather,</b> there is not <b>even</b> any reason <b>for concern with regard to a fly lest</b> it <b>come and sit on the protrusion of</b> the letter <b><i>dalet</i> and erase it,</b> thereby <b>rendering it</b> the letter <b><i>reish</i>,</b> which could be a critical error. There is no concern of this erasure occurring, since <b>I have a certain substance that I put into the ink</b> and that prevents the writing from being erased, <b>and it is called iron sulfate.</b>",
        "The Gemara questions the initial part of Rabbi Meir’s statement: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: When I was studying Torah before Rabbi Yishmael, I used to put iron sulfate into the ink</b> with which I wrote Torah scrolls, <b>and he did not say anything to me.</b> Afterward, <b>when I came</b> to learn Torah <b>with Rabbi Akiva, he prohibited me</b> from doing <b>so.</b>",
        "The Gemara points out that there are two separate contradictions between the two statements: Rav Yehuda’s statement with regard to Rabbi Meir first <b>serving</b> Rabbi Akiva as a disciple is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i> with regard to his first <b>serving</b> Rabbi Yishmael. Furthermore, Rav Yehuda’s statement is <b>difficult,</b> since he states that it was Rabbi Yishmael <b>who prohibited</b> the addition of iron sulfate, and this is contradicted <b>by</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that it was Rabbi Akiva <b>who prohibited it.</b>",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between Rav Yehuda’s statement with regard to Rabbi Meir’s <b>serving</b> Rabbi Akiva first, and the statement of the <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>serving</b> Rabbi Yishmael first, poses <b>no difficulty. Initially, he came before Rabbi Akiva</b> to study, but <b>since he could not comprehend his</b> extremely complicated <b>method</b> of learning, <b>he came before Rabbi Yishmael and learned</b> the oral <b>tradition</b> from him. Afterward, <b>he returned</b> and <b>came before Rabbi Akiva</b> and <b>studied</b> his method of logical <b>reasoning</b> in order to understand the reasons behind the <i>halakhot</i> he had already learned.",
        "<b>However,</b> the contradiction between Rav Yehuda’s statement that it was Rabbi Yishmael <b>who prohibited</b> the addition of iron sulfate and the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that it was Rabbi Akiva <b>who prohibited it</b> still poses a <b>difficulty.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, the matter is <b>difficult.</b>",
        "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Iron sulfate may be put into the ink</b> that is used <b>for all</b> sacred writings, i.e., Torah scrolls, phylacteries, and <i>mezuzot</i>,"
      ],
      [
        "<b>except for</b> the ink used to write the Torah <b>passage about the <i>sota</i>,</b> even when written in a Torah scroll. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says in the name of</b> Rabbi Meir: It is <b>except for</b> the ink used to write the scroll with the <b><i>sota</i> passage</b> used <b>in the Temple.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between these</b> two opinions? The Gemara replies: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that there is a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to whether it is permitted <b>to erase</b> the passage <b>for</b> the <i>sota</i> <b>from a Torah</b> scroll. According to Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Meir holds that this is permitted, and therefore the passage in the Torah scroll must be written with ink that does not contain iron sulfate, so that it can be erased. By contrast, according to Rabbi Ya’akov, Rabbi Meir holds that it is prohibited to erase the passage from a Torah scroll, and therefore the passage may be written with ink containing iron sulfate.",
        "The Gemara assumes that according to Rabbi Ya’akov it is prohibited to erase the passage from a Torah scroll, since he holds that the scroll must be written for the sake of the <i>sota</i>, whereas Rabbi Yehuda, who permits this, holds that the scroll need not be written for the sake of the <i>sota</i>. <b>And</b> therefore, the opinions of <b>these <i>tanna’im</i> are parallel</b> to the opinions of <b>those <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The scroll</b> of one <i>sota</i> <b>is not fit</b> to be used in the preparation of the water <b>to give</b> to <b>another <i>sota</i> to drink,</b> as it was not written for the sake of the other <i>sota</i>. <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya says: Her scroll is fit</b> to be used in the preparation of the water <b>to give</b> to <b>another <i>sota</i> to drink,</b> since it does not need to be written for the sake of the <i>sota</i>.",
        "<b>Rav Pappa said: Perhaps</b> that <b>is not so,</b> and the two disputes are not comparable. It is possible that <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>states</b> that the scroll may not be used for another <i>sota</i> <b>only there,</b> in the case if a scroll written for a specific woman; <b>since it was</b> originally <b>designated in the name of</b> one woman, e.g., <b>Rachel, it cannot again be designated in the name of</b> another woman, e.g., <b>Leah. However,</b> in the case of <b>a Torah</b> scroll, <b>which is written without specifying</b> anyone, <b>indeed we may erase</b> the passage to prepare the water for a <i>sota</i> even though it was not written for her sake.",
        "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that the comparison between the two disputes can be refuted for a different reason: <b>Perhaps</b> that <b>is not so.</b> It is possible that <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya states</b> that the scroll may be used for another <i>sota</i> <b>only there, with regard to</b> the <b>scroll</b> written for a specific <i>sota</i>, <b>as it was written for the purpose of</b> the <b>curses</b> of a <i>sota</i> <b>in general. However,</b> in the case of <b>a Torah</b> scroll, <b>which is written to be learned</b> from, <b>indeed we may not erase</b> it for a <i>sota</i>, as it was not written for the sake of a <i>sota</i> at all.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And doesn’t Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya hold</b> in accordance with that which is taught in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 24a): With regard to one who <b>wrote</b> a bill of divorce with which <b>to divorce his wife but</b> later <b>reconsidered</b> and did not divorce her, if <b>a resident of his city found him and said to him: My name</b> is the same <b>as your name, and my wife’s name</b> is the same <b>as your wife’s name;</b> give me the bill of divorce, and I will use it to divorce my wife, it <b>is unfit to divorce</b> the other woman <b>with it.</b> The reason for this is that it was written for the sake of another woman. Seemingly, the same principle should apply with regard to the scroll of a <i>sota</i>.",
        "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>the Merciful One states: “And he shall write for her</b> a bill of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:1). This teaches that <b>we require the writing</b> to be performed <b>for the sake of</b> the specific woman. However, no similar requirement is mentioned with regard to a <i>sota</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to the <i>sota</i>, the verse states: <b>“And</b> the priest shall <b>perform with her</b> all of this law” (Numbers 5:30), indicating that the ritual must be performed for the sake of the specific woman. The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the <b>performance</b> referred to in the verse? It is referring to the <b>erasure,</b> whereas the writing need not be done for the sake of a specific woman.",
        "§ The mishna states: When a guilty woman drinks <b>she does not manage to</b> finish <b>drinking before her face</b> turns green and her eyes bulge, and her skin becomes full of protruding veins. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna, which indicates that the water evaluates her while she is still drinking? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> The priest <b>sacrifices her meal-offering and afterward forces her to drink, because</b> according to the opinion of the Rabbis the meal-offering is sacrificed only after she drinks, and <b>as long as her meal-offering has not been sacrificed the water does not evaluate her, as it is written:</b> “And he shall bring her offering for her…for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, <b>a meal-offering of remembrance, a reminder of iniquity”</b> (Numbers 5:15).",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>she has merit, it delays</b> her punishment <b>for her. We arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as, if</b> this statement were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, didn’t he say: Merit does not delay</b> punishment <b>in</b> the case of <b>the bitter water</b> of a <i>sota</i>?",
        "<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says:</b> The priest <b>sacrifices her meal-offering and afterward forces her to drink.</b> With regard to the order of the ritual he holds in accordance with Rabbi Shimon, <b>and with regard to</b> the matter of <b>merit</b> delaying punishment, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>",
        "§ The mishna states: <b>And</b> the people standing in the Temple <b>say: Remove her,</b> so that she does not render the Temple courtyard impure. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>lest she die</b> there immediately and render the women’s courtyard, where she drinks the water, impure. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that a corpse is prohibited</b> from being <b>in</b> the women’s courtyard, which has the same status as the <b>Levite camp</b> in the desert?",
        "<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse is permitted to enter the Levite camp.

        "<b>Abaye said:</b> The woman is removed not due to a concern that she will die there but <b>lest</b> the fear of the water cause her to <b>begin to menstruate,</b> and it is prohibited for a menstruating woman to enter the Levite camp. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that fear causes</b> muscular <b>relaxation</b> and menstrual bleeding? The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, as it is written: “And the Queen was exceedingly pained”</b> (Esther 4:4), <b>and Rav says:</b> This means that <b>she began to menstruate.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 39a) that <b>trepidation eliminates</b> the flow of menstrual <b>blood?</b> Presumably, the <i>sota</i> experiences trepidation. The Gemara answers: <b>Trepidation</b> generated by extended worry <b>contracts</b> the muscles and prevents the blood from flowing, but sudden <b>fear relaxes</b> the muscles and causes the blood to flow.",
        "§ The mishna states: <b>If she has merit, it</b> delays punishment…for one year…for two years…for three years. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Yosei ben Ḥanan, and not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Yitzḥak of Kefar Darom, and not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael.</b>",
        "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If she has merit, it delays</b> punishment <b>for her</b> for <b>three months, equivalent</b> to the time necessary <b>to recognize the fetus;</b> this is <b>the statement of Abba Yosei ben Ḥanan. Rabbi Elazar ben Yitzḥak of Kefar Darom says:</b> Merit delays punishment for <b>nine months, as it is stated: “Then she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed”</b> (Numbers 5:28). It is possible to infer from this that if she has merit she will be cleared temporarily, for the length of time required to conceive a child, <b>and there,</b> in Psalms, <b>it says: “A seed shall serve him; it shall be told</b> of the Lord unto the next generation” (Psalms 22:31). This indicates that the <b>seed</b> must <b>be fit to tell</b> of the Lord once it matures, and a child can live only if it is born after the culmination of nine months in the womb.",
        "<b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> Merit delays punishment for <b>twelve months. And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof for the concept</b> of merit delaying punishment for twelve months, there is <b>an allusion to the concept, as it is written</b> that Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar after interpreting Nebuchadnezzar’s dream concerning the evil which would befall him: <b>“Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and redeem your sins with charity, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor;</b>"

None of the opinions in the <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the mishna’s statement that merit can delay punishment for up to three years.",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who states that merit delays punishment for one year, <b>and he found a verse which states and repeats</b> the possibility that punishment can be delayed, indicating that merit can delay punishment up to three times, <b>as it is written: “Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Edom,</b> yes, but for four, I will not reverse it” (Amos 1:11). Punishment can therefore be delayed for three consecutive periods of one year.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> does Rabbi Yishmael mean by stating: <b>Although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof for the concept</b> of merit delaying punishment for twelve months, there is <b>an allusion to the concept?</b> The verses he cites state explicitly that punishment can be delayed for twelve months. The Gemara answers: The proof is not explicit, as <b>perhaps gentiles are different, as</b> swift <b>judgment is not administered upon them</b> as readily as it is upon the Jewish people, with whom God is more precise in executing judgment.",
        "§ The mishna states: <b>And there is a merit</b> that <b>delays</b> punishment for <b>three years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Which merit</b> can delay the punishment of a <i>sota</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is the <b>merit of</b> the <b>Torah</b> that she has studied; <b>but</b> a woman who studies Torah <b>is</b> one who is <b>not commanded</b> to do so <b>and performs</b> a mitzva, whose reward is less than that of one who is obligated? Therefore, it would be insufficient to suspend her punishment. <b>Rather,</b> perhaps it is the <b>merit of a mitzva</b> that she performed.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Does</b> the <b>merit of a mitzva protect</b> one <b>so much</b> as to delay her punishment? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei interpreted this</b> verse <b>homiletically: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). <b>The verse associates the mitzva with a lamp and the Torah with</b> the <b>light</b> of the sun. <b>The mitzva</b> is associated <b>with a lamp</b> in order <b>to say to you: Just as a lamp does not protect</b> one by its light extensively but <b>only temporarily,</b> while the lamp is in one’s hand, <b>so too, a mitzva protects</b> one <b>only temporarily,</b> i.e., while one is performing the mitzva.",
        "<b>And the Torah</b> is associated <b>with light</b> in order <b>to say to you: Just as</b> the <b>light</b> of the sun <b>protects</b> one <b>forever, so too,</b> the <b>Torah</b> one studies <b>protects</b> one <b>forever; and it states</b> in the previous verse with regard to the Torah: <b>“When you walk, it shall lead you;</b> when you lie down, it shall watch over you; and when you awake, it shall talk with you” (Proverbs 6:22). The Gemara explains: <b>“When you walk, it shall lead you”; this is</b> referring to when one is in <b>this world. “When you lie down, it shall watch over you”; this is</b> referring to the time of <b>death,</b> when one lies in his grave. <b>“And when you awake, it shall talk with you”;</b> this is referring <b>to the time to come</b> after the resurrection of the dead. The Torah that one studies protects and guides him both in this world and in the next world.",
        "This can be illustrated by <b>a parable,</b> as it is comparable <b>to a man who is walking in</b> the <b>blackness of night and the darkness, and he is afraid of the thorns, and of the pits, and of the thistles,</b> which he cannot see due to the darkness. <b>And</b> he is also afraid <b>of</b> the <b>wild animals and of the bandits</b> that lurk at night, <b>and he does not know which way he is walking.</b>",
        "If <b>a torch of fire comes his way,</b> which is analogous to a mitzva, <b>he is safe from the thorns and from the pits and from the thistles, but he is still afraid of</b> the <b>wild animals and of the bandits, and</b> still <b>does not know which way he is walking. Once the light of dawn rises,</b> which is analogous to Torah study, <b>he is safe from</b> the <b>wild animals and from the bandits,</b> which no longer roam the roads, <b>but he still does not know which way he is walking.</b> If <b>he arrives at a crossroads</b> and recognizes the way, <b>he is saved from all of them.</b>",
        "<b>Alternatively,</b> the verse associates the mitzva with a lamp and the Torah with the light of the sun in order to teach that <b>a transgression extinguishes</b> the merit of <b>a mitzva</b> one performed, <b>but a transgression does not extinguish</b> the merit of the <b>Torah</b> one studied, <b>as it is stated: “Many waters cannot extinguish the love,</b> neither can the floods drown it” (Song of Songs 8:7). The Torah is compared to love several times in the Song of Songs. One can conclude from the <i>baraita</i> that the merit of performing a mitzva is insufficient to suspend punishment.",
        "<b>Rav Yosef said</b> that with regard to <b>a mitzva, at the time when one is engaged in its</b> performance it <b>protects</b> one from misfortune <b>and saves</b> one from the evil inclination; <b>at the time when one is not engaged in its</b> performance, it <b>protects</b> one from misfortune but it <b>does not save</b> one from the evil inclination. With regard to <b>Torah</b> study, <b>both at the time when one is engaged in it and at the time when one is not engaged in it,</b> it <b>protects</b> one from misfortune <b>and saves</b> one from the evil inclination. Therefore, the merit of the woman’s mitzvot does protect her from misfortune and delay her punishment.",
        "<b>Rabba objects to this</b> explanation: <b>If that is so,</b> then with regard to <b>Doeg</b> (see I Samuel, chapters 21–22) <b>and Ahithophel</b> (see II Samuel, chapter 16), who were both wise scholars despite their wickedness, <b>did they not engage in the</b> study of <b>Torah? Why did</b> it <b>not protect them</b> from sinning? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>Torah</b> study, <b>at the time when one is engaged in it, it protects and saves; at the time when one is not engaged in it, it protects</b> one from misfortune but <b>it does not save</b> one from the evil inclination. With regard to <b>a mitzva, both at the time when one is engaged in its</b> performance <b>and at the time when one is not engaged in its</b> performance, <b>it protects</b> one from misfortune but it <b>does not save</b> one from the evil inclination.",
        "<b>Ravina said: Actually,</b> the merit that delays the punishment of the <i>sota</i> is the <b>merit of Torah</b> study, <b>and</b> with regard to that <b>which you say,</b> i.e., that <b>she is not commanded</b> to do so <b>and performs</b> a mitzva, the mishna is not referring to the merit of her own Torah study. <b>Granted, she is not commanded</b> to study Torah herself; however, <b>in reward for causing their sons to read</b> the Written Torah <b>and to learn</b> the Mishna, <b>and</b> for <b>waiting for their husbands until they come</b> home <b>from the study hall, don’t they share</b> the reward <b>with their</b> sons and husbands? Therefore, if the <i>sota</i> enabled her sons and husband to study Torah, the merit of their Torah study can protect her and delay her punishment.",
        "With regard to the aforementioned parable, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the <b>crossroads,</b> which provide clarity? <b>Rav Ḥisda says: This</b> is referring to <b>a Torah scholar and</b> his <b>day of death.</b> Due to his continued commitment to the Torah, when the time comes for him to die, it is clear to him that he will go to the place of his eternal reward. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: This is a Torah scholar</b> who has also acquired <b>fear of sin,</b> as his fear of sin guides him to the correct understanding of the Torah. <b>Mar Zutra says: This is a Torah scholar who reaches</b> conclusions from <b>his discussion in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>,</b> as that is an indication that he is following the right path.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Alternatively: A transgression extinguishes</b> the merit of <b>a mitzva, but a transgression does not extinguish</b> the merit of the <b>Torah. Rav Yosef says: Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei interpreted this verse as</b> it was given on Mount <b>Sinai, and had Doeg and Ahithophel only interpreted it in this way they would not have pursued David, as it is written:</b> “For my enemies speak concerning <b>me…saying, God has forsaken him;</b> pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver” (Psalms 71:10–11). Doeg and Ahithophel incorrectly thought that since David had sinned, his sins had extinguished his merits and God had forsaken him.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> verse <b>did</b> Doeg and Ahithophel <b>interpret</b> incorrectly, causing them to err? They interpreted this verse: “For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp…to give up your enemies before you…<b>that He see no licentious matter in you,</b> and turn away from you” (Deuteronomy 23:15), to indicate that God turns away from one who engaged in forbidden relations, and since David had sinned with Bathsheba God must have turned away from him. <b>But they did not know that a transgression extinguishes</b> the merit of <b>a mitzva, but a transgression does not extinguish</b> the merit of the <b>Torah.</b>",
        "The Gemara interprets the continuation of the verse cited by the <i>baraita</i> with regard to Torah study: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: “Many waters cannot extinguish the love…if a man would give all the fortune of his house for love, <b>he would utterly be condemned”</b> (Song of Songs 8:7)? The Torah is compared to love several times in the Song of Songs. Therefore, the verse indicates that one cannot acquire a share in the reward for Torah study with money. <b>Ulla says:</b> The verse is <b>not</b> speaking of individuals <b>like Shimon, brother of Azarya,</b> whose brother Azarya supported him and enabled him to study Torah. <b>And</b> it is <b>not</b> speaking of individuals <b>like Rabbi Yoḥanan of the house of the <i>Nasi</i>,</b> whom the <i>Nasi</i> supported so that he could study Torah.",
        "<b>Rather,</b> it is speaking of individuals <b>like Hillel and Shevna, as when Rav Dimi came</b> to Babylonia <b>he said: Hillel and Shevna were brothers; Hillel engaged in Torah</b> study and remained impoverished, whereas <b>Shevna entered into a</b> business <b>venture</b> and became wealthy. <b>In the end,</b> Shevna <b>said to</b> Hillel: <b>Come, let us join</b> our wealth <b>together and divide</b> it between us; I will give you half of my money and you will give me half of the reward for your Torah study. In response to this request <b>a Divine Voice issued forth and said: “If a man would give all the fortune of his house</b> for love, he would utterly be condemned” (Song of Songs 8:7)."

        "Samson’s parents were being told that <b>the oath of Abimelech,</b> king of the Philistines, <b>was negated, as it is written</b> that Abimelech said to our forefather Abraham: “Now therefore swear unto me here by God <b>that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son;</b> but according to the kindness that I have done unto you, you shall do to me, and to the land wherein you have sojourned” (Genesis 21:23). The oath of the descendants of Abraham was no longer binding since the Philistines broke their oath by subjugating the Jewish people.",
        "The verse states: “And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; <b>and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him”</b> (Judges 13:24). The Gemara asks: <b>With what did He bless him? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It means <b>that He blessed him with regard to his penis,</b> that despite his youth <b>his penis</b> should function <b>like</b> that of physically mature <b>men, and</b> that <b>his seed</b> should be <b>like an overflowing river.</b>",
        "Prior to Samson’s death, the verse states: <b>“And Samson called unto the Lord, and said: Lord God, remember me, I pray to You, and strengthen me, I pray to You, only this once,</b> O God, <b>that I may be this once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes”</b> (Judges 16:28). <b>Rav said</b> that <b>Samson said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, remember</b> on <b>my</b> behalf the <b>twenty-two years that I judged the Jewish people</b> without receiving any reward, <b>and I did not</b> even <b>say to any one of them: Move a stick for me from</b> one <b>place to</b> another <b>place.</b>",
        "The verse states earlier: <b>“And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes,</b> and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails” (Judges 15:4). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>foxes</b> than any other animal, that he chose them for this purpose? <b>Rabbi Aivu bar Nagdi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: Samson said: Let</b> the animal <b>that goes in reverse</b> when it tries to escape, i.e., the fox, <b>come and exact punishment from the Philistines, who reneged on their oath</b> that Abimelech swore to Abraham.",
        "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon the Pious said:</b> The width <b>between the shoulders of Samson was sixty cubits, as it is stated: “And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and grabbed hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders,</b> and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron” (Judges 16:3). The verse indicates that the width of the gate of the city of Gaza was equal to the width of Samson’s shoulders, <b>and it is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that doors</b> of the gate <b>of Gaza were no less than sixty cubits</b> wide.",
        "With regard to Samson’s capture, the verse states: “And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; <b>and he did grind in the prison-house”</b> (Judges 16:21). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Grinding is nothing other</b> than <b>a language of a transgression</b> of sexual intercourse, <b>and so</b> the verse <b>says: “Then let my wife grind unto another man”</b> (Job 31:10). This <b>teaches that each and every</b> Philistine man <b>brought his wife to the prison in order that she should be impregnated by</b> Samson. <b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> is an example of the folk saying <b>that people say: Before a wine drinker,</b> bring <b>wine; before one who digs in the ground,</b> bring <b>figs.</b> So too, Samson, who married Philistine women, was brought more Philistine women while in prison.",
        "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who commits adultery, his wife commits adultery against him, as it is stated: “If my heart has been enticed unto a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door”</b> (Job 31:9), <b>and it is written: “Then let my wife grind unto another man and may strangers kneel over her”</b> (Job 31:10). <b>And this</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: He is</b> found <b>among the pumpkins [<i>karei</i>] and his wife among the zucchinis [<i>butzinei</i>],</b> which are similar types of vegetables. In other words, she acts the same way that he does.",
        "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Samson judged the Jewish people as their Father in Heaven</b> does, with complete justice, <b>as it is stated: “Dan shall judge his people, as one</b> of the tribes of Israel” (Genesis 49:16), which is interpreted to mean that Samson, from the tribe of Dan, judges his people just as God, Who is “One.” <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Samson [<i>Shimshon</i>] is called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “For the Lord God is a sun [<i>shemesh</i>] and a shield”</b> (Psalms 84:12). The Gemara comments: <b>If that is so,</b> then his name <b>should not be erased</b> just like other sanctified names are not erased. <b>Rather,</b> he is not called by the name of God but his name <b>is akin to the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> for <b>just as the Holy One, Blessed be He, protects the entire world, so too Samson, in his generation, protected all the Jewish people.</b>",
        "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Balaam was lame in one of his legs, as it is stated</b> with regard to him: <b>“And he went, limping [<i>shefi</i>]”</b> (Numbers 23:3). <b>Samson was lame in</b> both of <b>his two legs, as it is stated</b> that when Jacob mentioned the tribe of Dan in the prophecy that pertained to Samson, he referred to him as: “Dan shall be a serpent in the way, <b>a horned snake [<i>shefifon</i>] in the path”</b> (Genesis 49:17), which is double <i>shefi</i>, i.e., doubly lame.",
        "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Five</b> individuals <b>were created</b> with a characteristic that is <b>akin to a representation of the</b> One on <b>High, and they were all stricken by that</b> characteristic. <b>Samson</b> was glorified <b>in his strength, Saul in his neck</b> (see I Samuel 9:2), <b>Absalom in his hair, Zedekiah in his eyes,</b> and <b>Asa in his feet.</b>",
        "The Gemara clarifies: <b>Samson</b> was stricken <b>by his strength,</b> which led to his demise, <b>as it is written:</b> “And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man and had the seven locks of his head shaved off; and she began to afflict him, <b>and his strength went from him”</b> (Judges 16:19).",
        "<b>Saul</b> was smitten <b>in his neck, as it is written:</b> “Then said Saul to his armor-bearer: Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and make a mock of me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. <b>Therefore, Saul took his sword and fell upon it”</b> (I Samuel 31:4); he fell with his neck upon the sword.",
        "<b>Absalom</b> was stricken <b>in his hair, as we will state later. Zedekiah</b> was stricken <b>in his eyes, as it is written:</b> “And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, <b>and put out the eyes of Zedekiah,</b> and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon” (II Kings 25:7).",
        "<b>Asa</b> was stricken <b>in his feet, as it is written:</b> “Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <b>But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet”</b> (I Kings 15:23). <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This indicates <b>that gout [<i>padagra</i>] grabbed hold of him. Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, said to Rav Naḥman: What are the circumstances</b> of <b>gout?</b> What pain does it involve? <b>He said to him:</b> It feels <b>like a needle</b> inserted <b>into living flesh.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where did he know this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Some say</b> that he himself <b>suffered from this</b> condition, <b>and some say</b> that <b>he heard it from his teacher, and some say</b> that he knew it through divine inspiration, as it stated: <b>“The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and His covenant, to make them know it”</b> (Psalms 25:14).",
        "<b>Rava taught: For what</b> reason was <b>Asa punished</b> in his feet? <b>Because he made Torah scholars perform forced labor [<i>angarya</i>], as it is stated: “Then King Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted;</b> and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timber thereof, with which Baasa had built, and King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah” (I Kings 15:22). The superfluous expression “unto all” indicates that the proclamation was issued to <b>everyone, including</b> Torah scholars. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the next phrase in the verse: <b>“None was exempted [<i>ein naki</i>]”? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This includes <b>even a bridegroom from his chamber and a bride from her canopy,</b> as the verse states with regard to a bridegroom: “He shall be free [<i>naki</i>] for his house one year” (Deuteronomy 24:5).",
        "§ <b>It is written</b> with regard to Samson: <b>“And Samson went down to Timnah,</b> and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines” (Judges 14:1), <b>and it is written</b> in the Torah passage concerning the incident of Judah and Tamar: “And it was told to Tamar, saying: <b>Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah</b> to sheer his sheep” (Genesis 38:13). The verses contain an apparent contradiction as to whether Timnah was a place to which one must descend or a place to which one must ascend. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> These terms do not refer to the manner of traveling to Timnah but are used figuratively. Concerning <b>Samson, who was disgraced there</b> in Timnah, the term indicating <b>descent is written with regard to his</b> journey. Concerning <b>Judah, who was elevated there,</b> the term indicating <b>ascent is written with regard to his</b> journey.",
        "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> differently: <b>There were two</b> cities named <b>Timnah, one</b> was reached <b>by descent</b> into a valley, <b>and one</b> was reached <b>by ascent.</b>",
        "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> differently: <b>There was one Timnah,</b> and it was located on the slope of a mountain. One <b>who came from this side</b> reached it by <b>descent, and</b> one <b>who came from that side</b> reached it by <b>ascent.</b> The Gemara presents examples of such cities: <b>For example: Vardonia, and Bei Varei, and the market of Neresh.</b>",
        "The verse states with regard to Tamar: “And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, <b>and sat in the entrance of Enaim [<i>befetaḥ einayim</i>],</b> which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife” (Genesis 38:14). The <i>amora’im</i> dispute the meaning of the word <i>einayim</i>. <b>Rabbi Alexandri says:</b> This <b>teaches that she went and she sat at the entrance</b> of the home <b>of Abraham our forefather, a place that all eyes hope to see it,</b> as she was certain that Judah would pass there. <b>Rabbi Ḥanin</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>a place called Enaim, and similarly</b> the verse <b>states</b> in the list of cities in Eretz Yisrael in the portion of Judah: <b>“Tappuah and Enam”</b> (Joshua 15:34).",
        "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says: She provided eyes [<i>einayim</i>] for her statements,</b> i.e., with her words she provided an opening [<i>petaḥ</i>] for Judah to solicit her. <b>When</b> Judah <b>solicited her</b> to engage in sexual intercourse with him, <b>he</b> first attempted to verify her status and <b>said to her:</b> Are <b>you perhaps are a gentile? She said to him: I am a convert.</b> He asked: <b>Perhaps you are a married woman? She said to him: I am an unmarried woman.</b> He asked: <b>Perhaps your father accepted betrothal for you</b> and you are unaware of it? <b>She said to him: I am an orphan.</b> He asked: <b>Maybe you are impure? She said to him: I am pure.</b>",
        "The Gemara discusses Abraham’s house: It is written: <b>“And he planted an <i>eshel</i> in Beersheba,</b> and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God” (Genesis 21:33). <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Abraham <b>made an orchard and planted in it all kinds of sweet things.</b>",
        "The tanna’im <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya</b> disagree as to the meaning of the word “<i>eshel</i>.” <b>One said</b> that it means <b>an orchard [<i>pardes</i>], and one said</b> that it means <b>an inn [<i>pundak</i>].</b> The Gemara continues: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that it means <b>an orchard, this is what is written: “And he planted,”</b> and this is suitable language for an orchard. <b>But according to the one who said</b> that he opened <b>an inn, what is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“and he planted”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And he shall plant [<i>vayitta</i>] the tents of his palace</b> between the seas and the beauteous holy mountain; and he shall come to his end, and none shall help him” (Daniel 11:45), indicating that the word vayitta, and he planted, is also used to indicate pitching tents.",
        "The verse there states: “And he planted an <i>eshel</i> in Beersheba, <b>and called there [<i>vayyikra</i>] on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God”</b> (Genesis 21:33). <b>Reish Lakish said: Do not read</b> this word literally as <b>“<i>vayyikra</i>,”</b> and he called,"
      ],
      [
        "but <b>rather</b> as <b><i>vayyakri</i>, and he caused</b> others <b>to call.</b> This <b>teaches that Abraham our forefather caused the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, to be called</b> out <b>in the mouth of all passersby. How so? After</b> the guests of Abraham <b>ate and drank, they arose to bless him. He said to them: But did you eat from</b> what is <b>mine?</b> Rather, <b>you ate from</b> the food of <b>the God of the world.</b> Therefore, <b>you</b> should <b>thank and praise and bless the One Who spoke and the world was</b> created. In this way, Abraham caused everyone to call out to God.",
        "The Gemara continues its discussion of the incident of Judah and Tamar. It is written: <b>“When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute, for she had covered her face”</b> (Genesis 38:15). The Gemara asks: <b>Because she had covered her face he thought her to be a prostitute?</b> Prostitutes usually uncover their faces in order to attract men.",
        "<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The verse means <b>that</b> Tamar <b>covered her face in the home of her father-in-law,</b> Judah. Therefore, he did not recognize her when her face was uncovered. <b>As Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Any daughter-in-law who is modest in the house of her father-in-law merits that kings and prophets emerge from her. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar. Prophets</b> emerged from her, <b>as it is written: “The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). <b>Kings</b> emerged from her, as seen <b>from David. And Rabbi Levi says: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors: Amoz,</b> father of Isaiah, <b>and Amaziah,</b> king of Judea, <b>were brothers.</b> This indicates that Isaiah was also from the house of David and therefore a descendant of Tamar.",
        "The verse describes Tamar’s court hearing: <b>“When she was brought forth [<i>mutzet</i>],</b> she sent to her father-in-law, saying: By the man whose these are, am I with child” (Genesis 38:25). The Gemara comments: <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>When she was <i>mitutzet</i>.</b> The word <i>mutzet</i> also carries the implication of being found. What then, is taught by the use of that term? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: After her signs,</b> which she was using to prove that she was impregnated by Judah, <b>were brought out,</b> the evil angel <b>Samael came and distanced them</b> from each other in an attempt to prevent Judah’s admission and Tamar’s survival, which would enable the birth of King David. The angel <b>Gabriel</b> then <b>came and moved</b> the signs <b>closer</b> again. Therefore, the word <i>mutzet</i> is used, as it alludes to the signs being found again.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>This is as it is written: “For the leader, upon <i>yonat eilem reḥokim</i>, a psalm [<i>mikhtam</i>] of David”</b> (Psalms 56:1). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> the verse means: <b>From the moment that her signs were distanced [<i>reḥokim</i>], she became like a mute dove [<i>yona illemet</i>].</b> And the phrase <b>“a psalm [<i>mikhtam</i>] of David”</b> means: The one <b>from whom David emerged, as he was modest [<i>makh</i>] and flawless [<i>tam</i>] with everyone. Alternatively, <i>mikhtam</i></b> indicates <b>that <i>makkato</i>,</b> the place on his body that would have required wounding [<i>makka</i>], <b>was complete [<i>tama</i>],</b> i.e., <b>that</b> David <b>was born circumcised. Alternatively, <i>mikhtam</i></b> indicates that <b>just as in his youth</b> David <b>made himself small in front of one who was greater than him</b> in order <b>to learn Torah</b> from that person, <b>so too, when he became great</b> and was crowned king, he still behaved in this manner, so that his modesty, <i>makh</i>, was complete, <i>tam</i>, all of his life.",
        "The verse concerning Tamar then states: <b>“She sent to her father-in-law, saying: By the man whose these are, am I with child”</b> (Genesis 38:25). The Gemara comments: <b>And let her say to him</b> explicitly that she was impregnated by him. <b>Rav Zutra bar Tuviyya says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is more amenable for a person to throw himself into a fiery furnace</b> if faced with the choice of publicly embarrassing another or remaining silent even if it leads to being burned, <b>and not humiliate another in public. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar,</b> as she was prepared to be burned if Judah did not confess, rather than humiliate him in public.",
        "The verse continues: “And she said: <b>Discern, please,</b> whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff” (Genesis 38:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: With</b> use of the word <b>discern</b> Judah <b>informed his father</b> that Joseph was lost, and also <b>with</b> use of the word <b>discern they informed</b> Judah about the signs. The Gemara explains: <b>With</b> the word <b>discern he informed</b> Jacob his father when he brought him the coat of Joseph and said to his father: “And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said: This have we found. <b>Discern now whether it is your son’s coat</b> or not” (Genesis 37:32). <b>With</b> the word <b>discern they informed him:</b> “And she said: <b>Discern, please, whose are</b> these.”",
        "It states: “Discern, <b>please [<i>na</i>].”</b> The word <b><i>na</i></b> is <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a language of request.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>She said to him: I request of you: Discern the image of your Creator</b> in every person, <b>and do not avert your eyes from me.</b>",
        "The verse states: <b>“And Judah acknowledged them, and said: She is more righteous than I;</b> forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son” (Genesis 38:26). <b>This is</b> the same <b>as Rav Ḥanin bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says: Joseph, who sanctified the name of Heaven in private</b> by not committing adultery with the wife of Potiphar, <b>merited that one letter from the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, was added to his</b> name, <b>as it is written: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>bihosef</i> ] for a testimony in his name,</b> when He went forth against the land of Egypt” (Psalms 81:6). In this verse the name Joseph is written with an additional letter <i>heh</i>, found in the ineffable name of God.",
        "He continues: <b>Judah, who sanctified the name of Heaven in public, merited that his entire</b> name <b>is called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> for all the letters of the ineffable name of God are included within the name of Judah, with the addition of the letter <i>dalet</i>. <b>When he confessed and said: “She is more righteous than I,” a Divine Voice went forth and said: You saved Tamar and her two children</b> in her womb <b>from</b> being burned by <b>the fire.</b> By <b>your life,</b> i.e., <b>in your merit, I will save three of your children from the fire.</b> And <b>who are they? Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</b> (see Daniel, chapter 3).",
        "Judah said: <b>“She is more righteous than I [<i>mimmenni</i>].”</b> The word “<i>mimmenni</i>” can also be understood as “from me,” with Judah thereby admitting that he is the father. The Gemara asks: <b>From where did he know</b> that it was in fact from him that Tamar was pregnant? The Gemara answers: <b>A Divine Voice went forth and said: From Me these hidden</b> matters <b>emerged,</b> and this woman will be the mother of royalty, which requires that Judah be the father.",
        "The same verse continues: <b>“And he knew her [<i>leda’atah</i>] again no more [<i>velo yasaf</i>],”</b> seemingly indicating that Judah did not engage in sexual intercourse with Tamar again. <b>Shmuel the Elder, father-in-law of Rav Shmuel bar Ami, says in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Ami:</b> The verse actually means that <b>once he knew</b> of <b>her</b> that her intentions were for the sake of Heaven, <b>he did not desist from</b> engaging in sexual intercourse with <b>her again,</b> as <b>it is written here: “<i>Velo yasaf od leda’atah</i>,” and it is written there</b> at the giving of the Torah: “These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, <b>with a great voice and it went on no more [<i>velo yasaf</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:18), which is interpreted to mean: A great voice that did not cease.",
        "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Absalom was</b> excessively <b>proud of his hair,</b> and therefore he was hung by his hair. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:16): <b>Absalom rebelled</b> and sinned <b>due to his hair, as it is stated:</b> “Now in all Israel <b>there was none</b> to be so much praised <b>as Absalom for his beauty;</b> from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <b>And when he shaved his head, as it was at every year’s end that he shaved it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he shaved it, and he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, by the king’s stone”</b> (II Samuel 14:25–26). What is the king’s stone? The Sages <b>taught: A stone with which the people of Tiberias and the people of Tzippori weigh</b> items.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: And since he was proud of his hair, <b>therefore, he was hung by his hair, as it is stated</b> in the verse describing the battle between the forces of David and Absalom: <b>“And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth, and his head caught hold of the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went on”</b> (II Samuel 18:9). After he was spotted by the opposing troops, Absalom <b>took a sword [<i>safseira</i>] and wanted to cut his hair</b> to save himself. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: At that moment,</b> the gates of <b>the netherworld opened beneath him</b> and he was afraid to fall into it, so he did not cut his hair, and he was killed by the opposing troops.",
        "It is written with regard to David’s reaction after he learns of the death of Absalom: <b>“And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went about he said: O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died in your place, O Absalom, my son, my son”</b> (II Samuel 19:1), and a few verses later it adds: <b>“And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice: O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son”</b> (II Samuel 19:5). The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> are there <b>these eight</b> mentions of <b>“my son”</b> by David, i.e., to what do they correspond? The Gemara answers: <b>Seven</b> times he said “my son,” by <b>which he raised him up from the seven chambers of Gehenna. And</b> as for <b>the other,</b> eighth, time, <b>some say that</b> David <b>brought</b> the <b>head</b> of Absalom <b>close to</b> Absalom’s <b>body, and some say that</b> with this eighth mention David <b>brought</b> Absalom <b>to the World-to-Come.</b>",
        "It is written there: <b>“Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself</b> the pillar, which is in the king’s valley; for he said: I have no son to keep my name in remembrance” (II Samuel 18:18). The Gemara asks: <b>What did</b> Absalom <b>take? Reish Lakish says: He engaged in a bad transaction for himself</b> by accepting bad advice for which he was punished. The verse continues: <b>“The pillar, which is in the king’s valley [<i>be’emek hammelekh</i>].” Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says:</b> This alludes to the pillar that is <b>in the deep [<i>amukka</i>] counsel of the King [<i>melekh</i>] of the universe,</b> as God had already decreed in the aftermath of the incident with Bathsheba that this would occur."

      "Similarly, if a husband divorced his wife, and while divorced <b>she secluded herself</b> with another man <b>and became defiled, and afterward</b> her husband <b>took her back</b> and remarried her, and he then warned her about a specific man, and she secluded herself, and she is now about to drink the water of the <i>sota</i>, <b>he cannot stipulate with her</b> that she take an oath that she did not become defiled during the period in which she was divorced. This is because her husband would become forbidden to her only if she had married another man after being divorced, not if she merely committed an act of promiscuity.",
      "<b>This is the principle:</b> In <b>every</b> case <b>where</b> if <b>she would engage in sexual intercourse</b> with someone else <b>she would not become forbidden to</b> her husband due to this act, <b>he may not stipulate with her</b> that her oath include that act. The oath can include only cases in which she would be rendered forbidden to him.",
      "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Hamnuna says:</b> In the case of <b>a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> who committed adultery, she</b> becomes <b>forbidden to her <i>yavam</i>. From where</b> is this derived? It is <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Nor as a widow waiting for my <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage, <b>nor</b> when <b>married</b> through levirate marriage.",
      "The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that a woman awaiting levirate marriage who committed adultery <b>is forbidden</b> to the <i>yavam</i>, <b>due to that</b> reason a husband <b>may stipulate with</b> a <i>sota</i> that she take an oath that she did not commit adultery while she was awaiting levirate marriage with him. <b>But if you say that</b> such a woman <b>does not become forbidden, how can</b> a husband <b>stipulate</b> this <b>with her? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>this is the principle:</b> In <b>every</b> case <b>where</b> if <b>she would engage in sexual intercourse</b> with someone else <b>she would not become forbidden to</b> her husband due to this act, <b>he may not stipulate with her</b> that her oath include that act? Clearly she must become forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> if she commits adultery.",
      "<b>They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna.</b> A woman awaiting levirate marriage who commits adultery does not become forbidden to the <i>yavam</i>.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Nor as a widow waiting for my <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage, <b>nor</b> when <b>married</b> through levirate marriage, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: Betrothal does not take effect</b> even <b>for</b> those who would be merely <b>liable for</b> violating ordinary <b>prohibitions</b> were they to be married. All agree that betrothal does not take effect for forbidden unions that carry the punishment of <i>karet</i>, e.g., unions between siblings. However, according to Rabbi Akiva, in matters of personal status an ordinary Torah prohibition is equivalent to prohibitions that carry the punishment of <i>karet</i>. <b>And</b> he therefore holds that just as a wife who commits adultery, rendering her liable to receive <i>karet</i>, is forbidden to her husband and must be divorced, so too, a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> who commits adultery, violating an ordinary Torah prohibition, <b>is considered to be a woman forbidden to</b> her <i>yavam</i>.",
      "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma:</b> If a man divorced his wife and then remarried her, and she then secluded herself and came to drink the water of a <i>sota</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to <b>whether a man</b> in that situation <b>may stipulate</b> with her <b>concerning</b> their <b>first marriage?</b> May he compel her to include in her oath that she did not commit adultery then either? Similarly, may a <i>yavam</i> stipulate with his <i>yevama</i> <b>concerning the marriage of his brother,</b> requiring her to attest that she did not commit adultery prior to the brother’s death? <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
      "The Gemara proposes: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> evidence from the conclusion of the mishna: <b>This is the principle:</b> In <b>every</b> case <b>where</b> if <b>she would engage in sexual intercourse</b> with someone else <b>she would not become forbidden to</b> her husband due to this act, <b>he may not stipulate with her</b> that her oath include that act. One may <b>therefore</b> infer <b>that he may indeed stipulate</b> with her concerning any case in which <b>she</b> would become <b>forbidden.</b> In both of the cases in question the woman would have become forbidden to her husband if she had been guilty. Therefore, the Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that he is entitled to stipulate in these cases.",
      "§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that “amen, amen” means: <b>Amen that I did not become defiled</b> in the past, amen that I will not become defiled in the future. With regard to this <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:2): <b>When Rabbi Meir said: Amen that I will not become defiled</b> in the future, he did <b>not</b> mean to say <b>that if</b> God knows that <b>she will become defiled</b> in the future, the <b>water</b> that she drinks now <b>evaluates</b> whether <b>she</b> will be unfaithful and passes judgment on her <b>from now. Rather,</b> he meant <b>that</b> in the event <b>that she becomes defiled</b> in the future, the <b>water</b> that she drinks now will <b>destabilize her and evaluate</b> then whether <b>she</b> was unfaithful.",
      "<b>Rav Ashi raised a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to <b>whether a man may stipulate</b> with his wife <b>concerning a later marriage,</b> in the event that he would divorce her and then remarry her? Do we say: <b>Now, at least,</b> if she remains faithful during this marriage, <b>she is not forbidden to him? Or perhaps</b> this includes a later marriage, as <b>sometimes</b> a man <b>divorces</b> his wife <b>and remarries her,</b> and if she then commits adultery she will become forbidden to him.",
      "The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> evidence from the mishna: <b>All agree that he may stipulate with her</b> through this oath <b>neither with regard to</b> what she did <b>before becoming betrothed</b> to him, <b>nor with regard to</b> what she will do <b>after she becomes divorced</b> from him. And if while divorced she <b>secluded herself</b> with another man <b>and became defiled, and afterward</b> her husband <b>took her back</b> and remarried her, <b>he may not stipulate</b> with her with regard to the period in which she was divorced, since that act does not render her forbidden to him. The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> if <b>he remarries her and she</b> then <b>becomes defiled,</b> she would be forbidden to him. Therefore, <b>he may indeed stipulate</b> with her in advance with regard to this. The Gemara states: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that this is so.",
      "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“This is the law of jealousy”</b> (Numbers 5:29), indicating that the same law is to be carried out in all cases of jealousy. This <b>teaches that the woman drinks and repeats,</b> i.e., she must drink a second time if she becomes a <i>sota</i> again.",
      "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The word <b>“this”</b> in the verse is a restricting term, indicating <b>that the woman does not drink and repeat. Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> in which <b>Neḥunya the ditch digger testified before us</b> in the name of his teachers <b>that the woman drinks and repeats, and we accepted his testimony with regard to two men, but not with regard to one man.</b> Even if she drinks the water of a <i>sota</i> while married to her first husband, she must drink again after violating a warning by her second husband. However, one husband cannot have his wife drink twice.",
      "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And the Rabbis say: The woman does not drink and repeat, whether with regard to one man or with regard to two men.</b>",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>as well, isn’t it written</b> in the verse: <b>“This,”</b> restricting the number of times a woman must drink? <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis</b> mentioned <b>later</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>as well, isn’t it written: “The law of</b> jealousy,” amplifying the number of times a woman must drink to include all cases of jealousy?",
      "<b>Rava said:</b> Different <i>halakhot</i> apply to different cases: <b>With regard to one husband</b> who accused his wife twice about <b>one paramour, everyone agrees that the woman does not drink and repeat,</b> having been proven innocent once,"

        "§ The mishna states: From here <b>ben Azzai states: A person is obligated to teach</b> his daughter Torah, so that if she drinks and does not die immediately, she will know that some merit of hers has delayed her punishment. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who teaches his daughter Torah is teaching her promiscuity.</b> The Gemara asks: Could it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that teaching one’s daughter Torah is actually teaching her <b>promiscuity? Rather, say:</b> It is considered <b>as if he taught her promiscuity.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Abbahu says: What is the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> statement? It is <b>as it is written: “I, wisdom, dwell with cunning”</b> (Proverbs 8:12), which indicates that <b>once wisdom enters into a person, cunning enters with it.</b> Rabbi Eliezer fears that the woman will use the cunning she achieves by learning the wisdom of the Torah to engage in promiscuous behavior.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> who disagree with him, <b>what do they do with this</b> verse: <b>“I, wisdom,</b> dwell with cunning [<i>orma</i>]”; how do they interpret it? The Gemara responds: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>for that which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> states, interpreting the word “<i>orma</i>” as nakedness rather than cunningness, <b>as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The matters of Torah do not endure except in one who stands naked for them, as it is stated: “I, wisdom, dwell with nakedness [<i>orma</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 8:12). This means that wisdom dwells only in one who is prepared to give away all of his possessions for the sake of Torah study. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The matters of Torah do not endure except in one who considers himself as one who does not</b> exist, <b>as it is stated: “But wisdom, it can be found in nothingness”</b> (Job 28:12).",
        "§ The mishna states that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: A woman desires</b> to receive the amount of a <i>kav</i> of food and a sexual relationship rather than to receive nine <i>kav</i> of food and abstinence. The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying? This is what</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>is saying: A woman desires to</b> receive the amount of <b>a <i>kav</i></b> of food <b>and with it a sexual relationship,</b> i.e., her husband’s availability to fulfill her sexual desires, rather <b>than nine <i>kav</i></b> of food <b>and</b> with it <b>abstinence,</b> and since her desires are of a sexual nature, it is undesirable for her to study Torah.",
        "§ The mishna continues: <b>He,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>would say: A foolish man of piety,</b> and a conniving wicked person, and an abstinent woman, and those who injure themselves out of false abstinence; all these are people who erode the world. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is considered a foolish man of piety? For example,</b> it is one who sees <b>that a woman is drowning in a river, and he says:</b> It is <b>not proper conduct to look at her</b> while she is undressed <b>and save her.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Who is considered a conniving wicked person? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is one who presents his statement to the judge before the other litigant comes</b> and thereby prejudices the judge in his favor. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: This</b> is referring to <b>one who gives a dinar to a poor man</b> in order <b>to complete</b> the sum of <b>two hundred dinars for him,</b> so that he will no longer be entitled to receive charity, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 8:8): <b>One who has two hundred dinars may not collect gleanings, forgotten</b> sheaves, <b><i>pe’a</i>, and</b> the <b>poor man’s tithe,</b> since he is not defined as poor. However, if <b>he has two hundred less</b> one <b>dinar, even</b> if <b>he is given one thousand</b> dinars <b>at once, he may collect.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Asi</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> A conniving wicked person is <b>one who provides advice</b> to male orphans <b>to sell from the small quantity of property</b> left to them by their father, before it is appropriated by the court for the purpose of providing for the daughters, who do not inherit property. This causes the daughters to lose their right to sustenance, because although it is improper to do so, the sale is valid, <b>as Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to male <b>orphans who preemptively sold</b> the property <b>from a small estate, that which they sold, they sold,</b> and the sons retain the money.",
        "<b>Abaye says:</b> A conniving wicked person <b>is one who provides advice to sell property in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who said: <b>My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you</b> die, <b>to so-and-so, and the first</b> beneficiary <b>entered</b> the property <b>and sold</b> it <b>and consumed</b> the profits, <b>the second</b> beneficiary <b>repossesses</b> the property <b>from the purchasers,</b> as the property belongs to him after the death of the first beneficiary; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The second</b> beneficiary receives <b>only that which the first</b> beneficiary <b>left,</b> since his sale is valid. However, it is not permitted to sell the property <i>ab initio</i>, since the giver intended for the second beneficiary to receive the property.",

        "§ The mishna states that <b>an abstinent woman</b> is among those who erode the world. <b>The Sages taught: A maiden who prays</b> constantly, <b>and a neighborly [<i>shovavit</i>] widow</b> who constantly visits her neighbors, <b>and a child whose months</b> of gestation <b>were not completed,</b> all <b>these are</b> people <b>who erode the world.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: We learned</b> the meaning of <b>fear of sin from a maiden, and</b> the significance of <b>receiving</b> divine <b>reward from a widow.</b> The meaning of <b>fear of sin</b> can be learned <b>from a maiden, as Rabbi Yoḥanan heard a certain maiden who fell on her face</b> in prayer, <b>and she was saying: Master of the Universe, You created the Garden of Eden and You created Gehenna, You created</b> the <b>righteous and You created</b> the <b>wicked.

        "The Gemara answers: <b>When it is stated</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that a maiden who prays constantly is one who erodes the world, it is referring, <b>for example,</b> to <b>Yoḥani bat Retivi,</b> who constantly prayed and pretended to be saintly but actually engaged in sorcery.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>a child whose months</b> of gestation <b>were not completed? Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted this</b> as alluding to an imperfect, incomplete <b>Torah scholar who scorns his teachers.</b>",

This washing clearly refers to the purging of spiritual sins, rather than bathing for the sake of cleanliness.",
        "The verse continues: <b>“And her maidens walked</b> along <b>[<i>holekhot</i>]</b> by the riverside” (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This walking</b> is <b>nothing other</b> than the <b>terminology of</b> going toward <b>death, and similarly it states: “Behold, I am going [<i>holekh</i>] to die”</b> (Genesis 25:32).",
        "The verse continues: <b>“And she saw the ark among the willows”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Once</b> her maidens <b>saw that</b> the daughter of Pharaoh <b>was intending to save Moses, they said to her: Our mistress, the custom of the world</b> is that when <b>a king of flesh and blood decrees a decree,</b> even <b>if all the world does not fulfill it,</b> at least <b>his children and members of his household fulfill it, and</b> yet <b>you are violating the decree of your father.</b> After the maidens tried to convince her not to save Moses, the angel <b>Gabriel came and beat them to the ground</b> and they died.",
        "The verse concludes: <b>“And she sent <i>amatah</i> to take it”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya</b> disagree as to the definition of the word “<i>amatah</i>.” <b>One says</b> that it means <b>her arm, and one says</b> that it means <b>her maidservant.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The one who says</b> that it means <b>her arm</b> explained it in this manner, <b>as it is written “<i>amatah</i>,”</b> which denotes her forearm. <b>And the one who says</b> that it means <b>her maidservant</b> explained it in this manner <b>because it does not</b> explicitly <b>write</b> the more common term: <b>Her hand [<i>yadah</i>].</b> Therefore, he understands that this is the alternative term for a maidservant, <i>ama</i>.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that it means <b>her maidservant, didn’t you say</b> earlier: <b>Gabriel came and beat them to the ground</b> and the maidservants died, so how could Pharaoh’s daughter send her? The Gemara answers: It must be <b>that</b> Gabriel <b>left her one</b> maidservant, <b>as it is not proper that a princess should stand alone.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that it means <b>her hand, let</b> the Torah <b>write</b> explicitly: <b>Her hand [<i>yadah</i>].</b> Why use the more unusual term <i>amatah</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches us that her arm extended [<i>ishtarbav</i>]</b> many cubits. <b>As the Master said</b> in another context: <b>And similarly you find with regard to the hand of Pharaoh’s daughter</b> that it extended, <b>and similarly you find with regard to the teeth of evildoers, as it is written: “You have broken [<i>shibbarta</i>] the teeth of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 3:8), <b>and Reish Lakish said: Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>shibbarta</i>, rather</b> read it as <b><i>sheribbavta</i>,</b> you have extended.",
        "The next verse states: <b>“And she opened it and saw it [<i>vatirehu</i>], even the child”</b> (Exodus 2:6). The Gemara comments: The verse states: “And she saw it”; <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>And she saw. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> In addition to Moses, <b>she saw the Divine Presence with him.</b> This is indicated by the usage of “saw it.”",

The verse <b>calls him “a child [<i>yeled</i>],” and</b> the same verse <b>calls him “a lad [<i>na’ar</i>].”</b> A Sage <b>teaches: He is</b> the age of <b>a child but his voice</b> is as loud and deep <b>as a lad;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: If</b> that is <b>so, you made Moses our teacher blemished,</b> since his voice was unusually deep. <b>Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that his mother made a canopy of youth,</b> i.e., a small canopy, <b>for him in the ark,</b> as <b>she said: Perhaps I will not merit to</b> see <b>his</b> wedding <b>canopy.</b>",
        "The verse concludes: <b>“And she had compassion on him, and said: This [<i>zeh</i>] is one of the Hebrews’ children”</b> (Exodus 2:6). The Gemara asks: <b>From where did she know</b> that he was a Hebrew child? <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: As she saw</b> that <b>he was circumcised.</b>",
        "The Gemara comments: The Pharaoh’s daughter said: <b>“This [<i>zeh</i>]</b> is one of the Hebrews’ children” (Exodus 2:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that she prophesied unknowingly,</b> as the intention of the word “<i>zeh</i>” was: <b>This</b> one <b>falls,</b> i.e., is cast, into the water, <b>but no other</b> will <b>fall</b> by means of water, for on that day Pharaoh’s decree was canceled.",
        "The Gemara explains: <b>And this is what Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And when they shall say to you: Seek unto the necromancers and the diviners, that chirp [<i>metzaftzefim</i>] and that mutter [<i>mahggim</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 8:19)? The explanation of their chirping and muttering is: <b>They see [<i>tzofin</i>], but they do not know what they are seeing; they enunciate [<i>mahggim</i>], but they do not know what they are enunciating.</b> Although necromancers and diviners do have some insight into the future, they do not see clearly enough to understand what they are actually seeing.",
        "The Gemara applies this to Pharaoh: Pharaoh’s astrologers <b>saw that the savior of the Jewish people would be stricken by water.</b> Therefore, <b>they arose and decreed: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river”</b> (Exodus 1:22); they thought that their vision indicated that Moses would be killed in the water. <b>Once</b> Jochebed <b>cast Moses</b> into the water, although he was protected in an ark, the astrologers <b>said: We no longer see</b> in the stars anything <b>like that sign</b> we saw as to the downfall of the leader of the Jews by water, and therefore at that moment <b>they canceled their decree. But they did not know that</b> what they saw foretold that Moses <b>would be stricken on account of the waters of Meribah.</b> They envisioned a downfall for Moses by water but didn’t fully comprehend their vision.",
        "<b>And this is what Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “These [<i>hemma</i>] are the waters of Meribah, where</b> the children of Israel <b>strove</b> with the Lord, and He was sanctified in them” (Numbers 20:13)? The verse indicates that <b>these are</b> the waters <b>that the astrologers of Pharaoh saw and</b> on account of which they <b>erred. And this is what Moses said:</b> “The people, among whom I am, <b>are six hundred thousand men on foot [<i>ragli</i>];</b> and yet You have said: I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month” (Numbers 11:21). <b>Moses said to the Jewish people: On account of me,</b> which is an alternative meaning of the word ragli, <b>all of you were saved,</b> as the decree to throw all males into the river was canceled on my account.",
        "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: That day</b> that Moses was placed in the river <b>was the twenty-first</b> day of the month <b>of Nisan. The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> should the <b>one who in the future will say</b> the <b>Song at the</b> Red <b>Sea on this day be stricken on this day?</b> As this was also the date on which the Red Sea would be parted during the salvation of the Exodus.",
        "<b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says: That day was</b> actually <b>the sixth</b> day of the month <b>of Sivan. The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> should the <b>one who in the future will receive</b> the <b>Torah on Mount Sinai on this day be stricken on this day?</b> As this was also the date on which the Torah was received.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that Moses was placed in the water <b>on the sixth of Sivan, you find</b> that there can be <b>three months</b> during which Moses was hidden after his birth; <b>as the Master said</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:7): Moses <b>died on the seventh of Adar, and Moses was born on the seventh of Adar. And</b> based on this, <b>from the seventh of Adar until the sixth of Sivan</b> there are <b>three months,</b> which correspond to the three months Moses was hidden before being placed in the water. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that it was <b>on the twenty-first of Nisan, how can you find</b> that he was hidden for three months?",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>That year was a leap year</b> in which there were two months of Adar. Moses was hidden <b>most of the first</b> month of the three, from the seventh day of the first Adar when he was born, <b>and most of the last</b> month of the three, i.e., all of Nisan until the twenty-first, <b>and the entire middle one.</b> All of this together is considered as three months.",
        "The Gemara now discusses the next verse in Exodus: <b>“Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter: Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women,</b> that she may nurse the child for you?” (Exodus 2:7). The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> that Pharaoh’s daughter would specifically want a nurse <b>of the Hebrew women?</b>",
        "The Gemara answers: This <b>teaches that</b> prior to this, <b>they took Moses around to all the Egyptian</b> wet nurses <b>and he did not</b> agree to <b>nurse</b> from any of them, as <b>he said:</b> Shall <b>a mouth that in the future</b> will <b>speak with the Divine Presence</b> actually <b>nurse something impure? And this is as it is written: “Whom shall one teach knowledge?</b> And whom shall one make understand the message?” (Isaiah 28:9). The prophet is asking: <b>To whom shall</b> God <b>teach</b> the <b>knowledge</b> of the Torah, <b>and to whom shall</b> God <b>make to understand the message</b> of the Torah? The answer is as the verse continues: <b>“Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts”</b> (Isaiah 28:9). The conclusion of the verse indicates that the Torah should be taught to the one who did not want to nurse from the milk of a gentile woman, i.e., Moses.",
        "The next verse states: <b>“And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Go.</b> And the maiden [<i>ha’alma</i>] went and called the child’s mother” (Exodus 2:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This <b>teaches that she went quickly like a maiden,</b> i.e., with the strength of one of marriageable age, and not as the young child that she was. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The word <b><i>ha’alma</i></b> is related to the word meaning to hide [<i>le’alem</i>], <b>for she hid her words</b> and didn’t tell Pharaoh’s daughter that she was bringing the baby’s mother.",
        "The next verse states what Pharaoh’s daughter said to Jochebed: <b>“And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Take this [<i>heilikhi</i>] child away,</b> and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it” (Exodus 2:9). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> Pharaoh’s daughter <b>is prophesying and she does not know what she is prophesying,</b> as the word <b><i>heilikhi</i></b> means: <b>This is yours [<i>ha shellikhi</i>],</b> i.e., this is your child. The next part of the verse states: <b>“And I will give you your wages.” Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This teaches that <b>with regard to righteous people, not only</b> is it so <b>that</b> God arranges <b>that their lost items are returned to them, but</b> He <b>also</b> arranges <b>that they get their wages,</b> as the son of Jochebed was returned to her and she also received payment for nursing him.",
        "Elsewhere, the verse states with regard to Miriam: <b>“And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took</b> a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances” (Exodus 15:20). The Gemara asks: Why is Miriam referred to as <b>“the sister of Aaron,” and not the sister of Moses? Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Miriam already <b>prophesied when she was</b> still <b>the sister of</b> only <b>Aaron,</b> i.e., before Moses was born."
      ],
      [
        "<b>And</b> as a child Miriam <b>would say: In the future, my mother will give birth to a son who will save the Jewish people. And once Moses was born, the entire house was filled with light. Her father arose and kissed her on her head. He said to her: My daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled. And once they put him into the river, her father arose and hit her on her head. He said to her: My daughter, where is your prophecy? And this is as it is written: “And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him”</b> (Exodus 2:4), i.e., <b>to know what will be the ultimate</b> resolution <b>of her prophecy.</b>",
        "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Joseph merited</b> to bury his father, resulting in a display of great honor to his father. The Gemara begins its discussion of the burial of Jacob by asking: <b>What is different initially that it is written: “And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh,</b> the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt” (Genesis 50:7), <b>and afterward</b> it says in the following verse: <b>“And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house;</b> only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen” (Genesis 50:8), indicating that the brothers of Joseph were second in importance to the Egyptians? <b>And what is different at the end that it is written: “And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren,” and afterward</b> it states: <b>“And all that went up with him to bury his father,</b> after he had buried his father” (Genesis 50:14), placing the brothers before the Egyptians?",
        "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Initially, before</b> the Egyptians <b>saw the honor of the Jewish people,</b> as the Gemara will soon explain, <b>they did not treat them</b> with <b>honor,</b> so the brothers were behind the servants of Pharaoh. <b>And in the end, when they saw their honor, they treated</b> the brothers with <b>honor.</b>",
        "The Gemara explains what honor was accorded to the family of Jacob: <b>As it is written: “And they came to the threshing floor of Atad,</b> which is beyond the Jordan, and there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven days” (Genesis 50:10). The word atad is the name of the boxthorn bush. <b>And does a boxthorn</b> bush <b>have a threshing floor?</b> Thorns are not collected and eaten. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> This <b>teaches that they surrounded the casket of Jacob with crowns, like this threshing floor that is surrounded with boxthorns, because the children of Esau and the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah</b> all <b>came</b> to the burial of Jacob.",
        "A Sage <b>taught:</b> Initially, <b>they all came to</b> wage <b>war</b> with the family of Jacob, but <b>once they saw the crown of Joseph,</b> the viceroy of Egypt, <b>hanging on the casket of Jacob, they all took their crowns and hung them on the casket of Jacob.</b> A Sage <b>taught: Thirty-six crowns were hung on the casket of Jacob.</b> This was the great honor accorded to the family of Jacob.",
        "The Gemara continues its discussion of Jacob’s burial. The verse states: <b>“And there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing”</b> (Genesis 50:10). It is <b>taught: Even horses and even donkeys</b> participated in the mourning.",
        "<b>Once they reached the Cave of Machpelah, Esau came and was preventing them</b> from burying Jacob there. <b>He said to them:</b> It says: “And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to <b>Mamre, to Kiryat Arba, the same is Hebron,</b> where Abraham and Isaac sojourned” (Genesis 35:27). <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> It is called <b>Kiryat Arba</b> because there <b>were four couples</b> buried there: <b>Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah.</b> Esau said: Jacob <b>buried Leah in his</b> spot, <b>and the</b> spot <b>that is remaining is mine.</b>",
        "The children of Jacob <b>said to</b> Esau: <b>You sold</b> your rights <b>to</b> Jacob. Esau <b>said to them: Though I sold the birthright, did I</b> also <b>sell</b> my rights to the burial site as <b>an ordinary</b> brother? The brothers <b>said to him: Yes,</b> you also sold to Jacob those rights, <b>as it is written</b> that Joseph stated: “My father made me swear, saying: Behold, I die; <b>in my grave that I have dug [<i>kariti</i>] for me</b> in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me” (Genesis 50:5). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> The word <b><i>kira</i></b> in the verse <b>is nothing other</b> than <b>a term of a sale [<i>mekhira</i>]</b> sharing a similar root, <b>because in the cities overseas they call a sale <i>kira</i>.</b>",
        "Esau <b>said to them: Bring the bill</b> of sale <b>to me,</b> i.e., you can’t prove your claims. <b>They said to him: The bill</b> of sale <b>is in the land of Egypt.</b> They said: <b>And who will go</b> to bring it? <b>Naphtali will go, for he is as fast as a doe, as it is written: “Naphtali is a doe let loose, he gives goodly words”</b> (Genesis 49:21). <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: Do not read</b> it as “<b>goodly words [<i>imrei shafer</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>imrei sefer</i>,</b> i.e., the words of the book, as he returned to Egypt to retrieve the bill of sale.",
        "The Gemara relates: <b>Hushim, the son of Dan, was there and his ears were heavy,</b> i.e., he was hard of hearing. <b>He said to them: What</b> is <b>this</b> that is delaying the burial? <b>And they said to him: This one,</b> Esau, <b>is preventing</b> us from burying Jacob <b>until Naphtali comes</b> back <b>from the land of Egypt</b> with the bill of sale. <b>He said to them: And until Naphtali comes</b> back <b>from the land of Egypt will</b> our <b>father’s father lie in degradation? He took a club [<i>kulepa</i>] and hit</b> Esau <b>on the head,</b> and Esau’s <b>eyes fell out and they fell on the legs of Jacob. Jacob opened his eyes and smiled. And this is that which is written: “The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 58:11).",
        "<b>At that moment the prophecy of Rebecca was fulfilled, as it is written</b> that Rebecca said of Jacob and Esau: <b>“Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”</b> (Genesis 27:45), as Rebecca foresaw that the future bereavement for both her sons would be on the same day. The Gemara comments: <b>And although their deaths were not on the same day, in any event their burials were on the same day,</b> as Esau was killed and buried on the same day that Jacob was buried.",
        "The Gemara returns to discuss the involvement of Joseph and his brothers in the burial of their father: <b>And if Joseph would not have dealt with</b> the burial of Jacob, <b>would his brothers not have dealt with it? But isn’t it written: “For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan,</b> and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah” (Genesis 50:13)? Since it is evident that the brothers were involved in the burial, why did they not deal with Jacob’s burial needs from the outset? The Gemara answers: <b>They said: Allow</b> Joseph to take care of it, because there is <b>more honor</b> for our father to be prepared for burial <b>by royalty than by common</b> people <b>[<i>hedyotot</i>].</b>",
        "§ It states further in the mishna: <b>Who, to us,</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Joseph,</b> as it was none other than Moses who involved himself in transporting his coffin. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (4:6–7): <b>Come and see how beloved mitzvot are to Moses our teacher. As,</b> at the time of the Exodus, <b>all the Jewish people were involved in</b> taking <b>the plunder</b> from Egypt, <b>and he was involved in</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot, as it is stated: “The wise in heart will take mitzvot”</b> (Proverbs 10:8).",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where did Moses our teacher know where Joseph was buried?</b> The Sages <b>said: Serah, the daughter of Asher, remained from that generation</b> that initially descended to Egypt with Jacob. <b>Moses went to her</b> and <b>said to her: Do you know anything</b> about <b>where Joseph is buried? She said to him: The Egyptians fashioned a metal casket for him and set it in the Nile [<i>Nilus</i>] River</b> as an augury <b>so that its water would be blessed. Moses went and stood on the bank of the Nile.</b> He <b>said to</b> Joseph: <b>Joseph, Joseph, the time has arrived</b> about <b>which the Holy One, Blessed be He, took an oath</b> saying <b>that I,</b> i.e., God, <b>will redeem you. And</b> the time for fulfillment of <b>the oath that you administered to the Jewish people</b> that they will bury you in Eretz Yisrael <b>has arrived. If you show yourself,</b> it is <b>good,</b> but <b>if not, we are clear from your oath. Immediately, the casket of Joseph floated</b> to the top of the water.",
        "<b>And do not wonder how iron</b> can <b>float, as it is written</b> in the verses describing how Elisha was able to cause iron to float: <b>“But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water;</b> and he cried, and said: <b>Alas, my master! For it was borrowed. And the man of God said: Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in there, and the iron floated up”</b> (II Kings 6:5–6). <b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: And just as Elisha,</b> who was a mere <b>student of Elijah, and Elijah</b> was a mere <b>student of Moses,</b> as Elijah studied the Torah of Moses, was able to cause the <b>iron</b> to <b>float before him, all the more so</b> would it float <b>before Moses our teacher</b> himself.",
        "The Gemara now presents a different version of where Joseph was buried. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> Joseph <b>was buried in the crypt [<i>kabbarnit</i>] of kings. Moses went and stood by the crypt of kings</b> and <b>said: Joseph, the time has arrived</b> about <b>which the Holy One, Blessed be He, took an oath</b> saying <b>that: I will redeem you. And</b> the time for fulfillment of <b>the oath that you administered to the Jewish people</b> that they will bury you in Eretz Yisrael <b>has arrived. If you show yourself,</b> it is <b>good, but if not, we are clear from your oath. At that moment, the casket of Joseph shook</b> among the caskets. <b>Moses took it and brought it</b> over <b>to himself.</b>",
        "<b>And all those years that the Jewish people were in the wilderness, these two arks, one</b> a casket <b>of a dead man,</b> Joseph, <b>and one</b> the Ark <b>of the Divine Presence,</b> i.e., the Ark of the Covenant, <b>were traveling together, and passersby would say: What is the nature of these two arks? They said</b> to them: <b>One</b> is <b>of a dead person and one</b> is <b>of the Divine Presence.</b> The passersby would ask: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way is it <b>the manner of a dead person to travel with the Divine Presence? They said</b> in response:"

He said to them: But did you eat from</b> what is <b>mine?</b> Rather, <b>you ate from</b> the food of <b>the God of the world.</b> Therefore, <b>you</b> should <b>thank and praise and bless the One Who spoke and the world was</b> created. In this way, Abraham caused everyone to call out to God.",
      "The Gemara continues its discussion of the incident of Judah and Tamar. It is written: <b>“When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute, for she had covered her face”</b> (Genesis 38:15). The Gemara asks: <b>Because she had covered her face he thought her to be a prostitute?</b> Prostitutes usually uncover their faces in order to attract men.",
      "<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The verse means <b>that</b> Tamar <b>covered her face in the home of her father-in-law,</b> Judah. Therefore, he did not recognize her when her face was uncovered. <b>As Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Any daughter-in-law who is modest in the house of her father-in-law merits that kings and prophets emerge from her. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar. Prophets</b> emerged from her, <b>as it is written: “The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). <b>Kings</b> emerged from her, as seen <b>from David. And Rabbi Levi says: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors: Amoz,</b> father of Isaiah, <b>and Amaziah,</b> king of Judea, <b>were brothers.</b> This indicates that Isaiah was also from the house of David and therefore a descendant of Tamar.",
      "The verse describes Tamar’s court hearing: <b>“When she was brought forth [<i>mutzet</i>],</b> she sent to her father-in-law, saying: By the man whose these are, am I with child” (Genesis 38:25). The Gemara comments: <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>When she was <i>mitutzet</i>.</b> The word <i>mutzet</i> also carries the implication of being found. What then, is taught by the use of that term? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: After her signs,</b> which she was using to prove that she was impregnated by Judah, <b>were brought out,</b> the evil angel <b>Samael came and distanced them</b> from each other in an attempt to prevent Judah’s admission and Tamar’s survival, which would enable the birth of King David. The angel <b>Gabriel</b> then <b>came and moved</b> the signs <b>closer</b> again. Therefore, the word <i>mutzet</i> is used, as it alludes to the signs being found again.",
      "The Gemara comments: <b>This is as it is written: “For the leader, upon <i>yonat eilem reḥokim</i>, a psalm [<i>mikhtam</i>] of David”</b> (Psalms 56:1). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> the verse means: <b>From the moment that her signs were distanced [<i>reḥokim</i>], she became like a mute dove [<i>yona illemet</i>].</b> And the phrase <b>“a psalm [<i>mikhtam</i>] of David”</b> means: The one <b>from whom David emerged, as he was modest [<i>makh</i>] and flawless [<i>tam</i>] with everyone. Alternatively, <i>mikhtam</i></b> indicates <b>that <i>makkato</i>,</b> the place on his body that would have required wounding [<i>makka</i>], <b>was complete [<i>tama</i>],</b> i.e., <b>that</b> David <b>was born circumcised. Alternatively, <i>mikhtam</i></b> indicates that <b>just as in his youth</b> David <b>made himself small in front of one who was greater than him</b> in order <b>to learn Torah</b> from that person, <b>so too, when he became great</b> and was crowned king, he still behaved in this manner, so that his modesty, <i>makh</i>, was complete, <i>tam</i>, all of his life.",
      "The verse concerning Tamar then states: <b>“She sent to her father-in-law, saying: By the man whose these are, am I with child”</b> (Genesis 38:25). The Gemara comments: <b>And let her say to him</b> explicitly that she was impregnated by him. <b>Rav Zutra bar Tuviyya says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is more amenable for a person to throw himself into a fiery furnace</b> if faced with the choice of publicly embarrassing another or remaining silent even if it leads to being burned, <b>and not humiliate another in public. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar,</b> as she was prepared to be burned if Judah did not confess, rather than humiliate him in public.",
      "The verse continues: “And she said: <b>Discern, please,</b> whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff” (Genesis 38:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: With</b> use of the word <b>discern</b> Judah <b>informed his father</b> that Joseph was lost, and also <b>with</b> use of the word <b>discern they informed</b> Judah about the signs. The Gemara explains: <b>With</b> the word <b>discern he informed</b> Jacob his father when he brought him the coat of Joseph and said to his father: “And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said: This have we found. <b>Discern now whether it is your son’s coat</b> or not” (Genesis 37:32). <b>With</b> the word <b>discern they informed him:</b> “And she said: <b>Discern, please, whose are</b> these.”",
      "It states: “Discern, <b>please [<i>na</i>].”</b> The word <b><i>na</i></b> is <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a language of request.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>She said to him: I request of you: Discern the image of your Creator</b> in every person, <b>and do not avert your eyes from me.</b>",
      "The verse states: <b>“And Judah acknowledged them, and said: She is more righteous than I;</b> forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son” (Genesis 38:26). <b>This is</b> the same <b>as Rav Ḥanin bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says: Joseph, who sanctified the name of Heaven in private</b> by not committing adultery with the wife of Potiphar, <b>merited that one letter from the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, was added to his</b> name, <b>as it is written: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>bihosef</i> ] for a testimony in his name,</b> when He went forth against the land of Egypt” (Psalms 81:6). In this verse the name Joseph is written with an additional letter <i>heh</i>, found in the ineffable name of God.",
      "He continues: <b>Judah, who sanctified the name of Heaven in public, merited that his entire</b> name <b>is called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> for all the letters of the ineffable name of God are included within the name of Judah, with the addition of the letter <i>dalet</i>. <b>When he confessed and said: “She is more righteous than I,” a Divine Voice went forth and said: You saved Tamar and her two children</b> in her womb <b>from</b> being burned by <b>the fire.</b> By <b>your life,</b> i.e., <b>in your merit, I will save three of your children from the fire.</b> And <b>who are they? Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</b> (see Daniel, chapter 3).",
      "Judah said: <b>“She is more righteous than I [<i>mimmenni</i>].”</b> The word “<i>mimmenni</i>” can also be understood as “from me,” with Judah thereby admitting that he is the father. The Gemara asks: <b>From where did he know</b> that it was in fact from him that Tamar was pregnant? The Gemara answers: <b>A Divine Voice went forth and said: From Me these hidden</b> matters <b>emerged,</b> and this woman will be the mother of royalty, which requires that Judah be the father.",
      "The same verse continues: <b>“And he knew her [<i>leda’atah</i>] again no more [<i>velo yasaf</i>],”</b> seemingly indicating that Judah did not engage in sexual intercourse with Tamar again. <b>Shmuel the Elder, father-in-law of Rav Shmuel bar Ami, says in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Ami:</b> The verse actually means that <b>once he knew</b> of <b>her</b> that her intentions were for the sake of Heaven, <b>he did not desist from</b> engaging in sexual intercourse with <b>her again,</b> as <b>it is written here: “<i>Velo yasaf od leda’atah</i>,” and it is written there</b> at the giving of the Torah: “These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, <b>with a great voice and it went on no more [<i>velo yasaf</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:18), which is interpreted to mean: A great voice that did not cease.",
      "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Absalom was</b> excessively <b>proud of his hair,</b> and therefore he was hung by his hair. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:16): <b>Absalom rebelled</b> and sinned <b>due to his hair, as it is stated:</b> “Now in all Israel <b>there was none</b> to be so much praised <b>as Absalom for his beauty;</b> from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <b>And when he shaved his head, as it was at every year’s end that he shaved it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he shaved it, and he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, by the king’s stone”</b> (II Samuel 14:25–26). What is the king’s stone? The Sages <b>taught: A stone with which the people of Tiberias and the people of Tzippori weigh</b> items.",
      "The <i>baraita</i> continues: And since he was proud of his hair, <b>therefore, he was hung by his hair, as it is stated</b> in the verse describing the battle between the forces of David and Absalom: <b>“And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth, and his head caught hold of the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went on”</b> (II Samuel 18:9). After he was spotted by the opposing troops, Absalom <b>took a sword [<i>safseira</i>] and wanted to cut his hair</b> to save himself. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: At that moment,</b> the gates of <b>the netherworld opened beneath him</b> and he was afraid to fall into it, so he did not cut his hair, and he was killed by the opposing troops.",
      "It is written with regard to David’s reaction after he learns of the death of Absalom: <b>“And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went about he said: O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died in your place, O Absalom, my son, my son”</b> (II Samuel 19:1), and a few verses later it adds: <b>“And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice: O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son”</b> (II Samuel 19:5). The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> are there <b>these eight</b> mentions of <b>“my son”</b> by David, i.e., to what do they correspond? The Gemara answers: <b>Seven</b> times he said “my son,” by <b>which he raised him up from the seven chambers of Gehenna. And</b> as for <b>the other,</b> eighth, time, <b>some say that</b> David <b>brought</b> the <b>head</b> of Absalom <b>close to</b> Absalom’s <b>body, and some say that</b> with this eighth mention David <b>brought</b> Absalom <b>to the World-to-Come.</b>",
      "It is written there: <b>“Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself</b> the pillar, which is in the king’s valley; for he said: I have no son to keep my name in remembrance” (II Samuel 18:18). The Gemara asks: <b>What did</b> Absalom <b>take? Reish Lakish says: He engaged in a bad transaction for himself</b> by accepting bad advice for which he was punished. The verse continues: <b>“The pillar, which is in the king’s valley [<i>be’emek hammelekh</i>].” Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says:</b> This alludes to the pillar that is <b>in the deep [<i>amukka</i>] counsel of the King [<i>melekh</i>] of the universe,</b> as God had already decreed in the aftermath of the incident with Bathsheba that this would occur."

        "<b>And the Rabbis prohibit</b> separating <i>ḥalla</i> in this manner.",
        "<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Eliezer even allows the ritually pure dough placed in the middle to be as large as <b>an egg-bulk,</b> even though dough of that size is susceptible to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity.",
        "The Gemara now explains the reasoning of those who tried to prove from here that Rabbi Eliezer is of the opinion that second-degree ritual impurity cannot impart third-degree ritual impurity upon non-sacred items: <b>They assumed</b> that both <b>this</b> mishna <b>and this</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to cases <b>where</b> the <b>dough</b> is of <b>first-</b>degree impurity. <b>And</b> furthermore, they assumed that all the <i>tanna’im</i> agree that <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> as its <i>ḥalla</i> has not yet been separated, <b>is not</b> treated <b>like <i>ḥalla</i></b> as far as its ability to contract third-degree ritual impurity. Rather, it is regarded as generic non-sacred food, which is susceptible only to second-degree impurity.",
        "Based on these assumptions the Gemara explains how these authorities understood the tannaitic dispute: <b>What, is it not</b> clear that Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the following matter: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that an item of second-degree impurity <b>cannot impart</b> third-degree impurity <b>to non-sacred items.</b> Therefore, there is no problem placing an egg-bulk of pure dough in the middle, as although it will touch the impure dough and will thereby contract second-degree impurity, nevertheless it is unable to transmit impurity to the pure dough.",
        "<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that an item of second-degree impurity <b>can impart</b> third-degree ritual impurity <b>to non-sacred items.</b> They therefore prohibit placing an egg-bulk of dough in the middle, as it will assume second-degree impurity status, which, in their opinion, can impart third-degree impurity status upon the pure dough.",
        "<b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said</b> that the dispute can be understood differently: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that an item of second-degree ritual impurity <b>cannot impart</b> third-degree ritual impurity <b>to non-sacred items. But here,</b> the dispute concerns another matter, as <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the status of <b>non-sacred</b> food that is <b>untithed vis-à-vis <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> as its <i>ḥalla</i> has not yet been separated. One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is</b> treated <b>like <i>ḥalla</i></b> with regard to its ability to contract third-degree impurity, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not</b> treated <b>like <i>ḥalla</i></b> and cannot contract third-degree impurity. Therefore, he permits separating <i>ḥalla</i> in this manner.",
        "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that they disagree with regard to a different issue: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that <b>non-sacred</b> food that is <b>untithed with regard to <i>ḥalla</i> is not</b> treated <b>like <i>ḥalla</i></b> and cannot contract third-degree impurity, <b>and</b> that an item of second-degree ritual impurity <b>cannot impart</b> third-degree ritual impurity <b>to non-sacred items. But here, they disagree with regard to</b> whether or not <b>it is permitted to cause ritual impurity to non-sacred</b> food <b>that is in Eretz Yisrael.</b>",
        "One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is permitted to cause impurity to non-sacred</b> food <b>that is in Eretz Yisrael.</b> Therefore, since the dough placed in the middle cannot impart third-degree ritual impurity status upon the dough designated for <i>ḥalla</i>, there is no reason to prohibit doing so. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is prohibited to cause impurity to non-sacred</b> food <b>that is in Eretz Yisrael.</b> Therefore, although the dough of the ritually pure batch will not become impure, nevertheless the Rabbis prohibit separating <i>ḥalla</i> in this manner, as causing the dough in the middle to become impure is prohibited.",
        "§ It is stated in the mishna: <b>On that same day Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> one of the contradictory verses with regard to the amount of land surrounding the Levite cities as teaching that one may not travel beyond a two-thousand-cubit radius around his city limits on Shabbat. Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, on the other hand, interprets the contradictory verses as referring to different types of land left for the Levites around their cities.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> halakhic matter <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of Shabbat <b>boundaries</b> is mandated <b>by Torah law,</b> as he bases it on a verse; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <b>holds</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of Shabbat boundaries is mandated <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and he therefore derives other matters from the verse.",
        "§ <b>The Sages taught: On that same day Rabbi Akiva taught</b> that <b>at the time that the Jewish people ascended from the</b> split <b>sea they set their eyes on reciting a song</b> of gratitude to God. <b>And how did they recite</b> the <b>song?</b> In the same manner <b>as an adult man reciting <i>hallel</i></b> on behalf of a congregation, as his reading enables all who hear to fulfill their obligation, <b>and</b> the congregation listening merely <b>recite after him the chapter headings</b> of <i>hallel</i>. So too, by the sea, <b>Moses said: “I will sing unto the Lord”</b> (Exodus 15:1), <b>and</b> the people <b>said</b> after Moses: <b>“I will sing unto the Lord.” Moses</b> continued and <b>said: “For He is highly exalted”</b> (Exodus 15:1), <b>and they said</b> once again the chapter heading: <b>“I will sing unto the Lord.”</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says:</b> The Jewish people sang just <b>like a minor boy reciting <i>hallel</i> and</b> the congregation who hear him <b>repeat after him all that he says,</b> word for word, as hearing the recital of a minor is insufficient for fulfilling one’s obligation. So too, by the sea, <b>Moses said: “I will sing unto the Lord”</b> (Exodus 15:1), <b>and</b> the people <b>said</b> after Moses: <b>“I will sing to the Lord.” Moses said: “For He is highly exalted,” and they said</b> after him the same words: <b>“For He is highly exalted.”</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> They sang the song of the sea <b>like a scribe,</b> a cantor, <b>who recites</b> aloud <b>the</b> introductory prayers and blessings before <b><i>Shema</i> in the synagogue; as he begins</b> by saying the <b>first</b> words of the blessing, <b>and they repeat after him</b> the initial words and continue reciting the rest of <i>Shema</i> together with him in unison. So too, in the song of the sea, Moses began and then everyone recited the entire song together with him.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers that they disagree with regard to the interpretation of the verse: “Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song unto the Lord, and said, saying” (Exodus 15:1). <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the word <b>“saying,”</b> which indicates that the people sang after Moses, is referring only <b>to the first words</b> of the song, which the people continually repeated: “I will sing unto the Lord” (Exodus 15:1).",
        "<b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, holds</b> that the word <b>“saying”</b> is referring <b>to every single word,</b> as they would repeat after Moses every word. <b>And Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that the phrase <b>“and they said”</b> (Exodus 15:1) indicates <b>that everyone recited</b> the song of the sea <b>together,</b> and the word <b>“saying”</b> means <b>that Moses began</b> singing the song <b>first;</b> and then the rest of the people sang the beginning after him and they all continued in unison.",
        "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught: At the time that the Jewish people ascended from the sea they resolved to sing</b> a song of gratitude to God. <b>And how did they recite</b> this song? If <b>a baby</b> was <b>lying on his mother’s lap or an infant</b> was <b>nursing from his mother’s breasts, once they saw the Divine Presence, the baby straightened his neck and the infant dropped the breast from his mouth, and they recited: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <b>As it is stated: “Out of the mouths of babies and sucklings You have founded strength”</b> (Psalms 8:3).",
        "<b>Rabbi Meir would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even fetuses in their mother’s womb recited</b> the <b>song</b> at the sea? <b>As it is stated:</b>"

      [
        "<b>“In full assemblies, bless God, the Lord, you that are from the source of Israel”</b> (Psalms 68:27), indicating that even children that are in the “source,” i.e., their mother’s womb, blessed God when they gathered at the sea.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the fetuses <b>could not see,</b> so how could they have honestly said: “This is my God and I will glorify him”? <b>Rabbi Tanḥum says:</b> Their mother’s <b>stomach was transformed for them like luminous crystal [<i>aspaklarya</i>], and they saw</b> through it.",
        "§ <b>On that same day Rabbi Yehoshua ben Hyrcanus taught that Job served</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>only</b> out of love, as it is stated: “Though He will slay me, still I will trust in Him [<i>lo</i>]” (Job 13:15). The mishna continues that the word <i>lo</i> in the verse is ambiguous as to whether it is indicative of Job expressing his yearning for God or his lack thereof. The Gemara asks: <b>Let us see whether this</b> word <b><i>lo</i> is written <i>lamed alef</i>,</b> and therefore its meaning <b>is:</b> I will <b>not</b> trust, or <b>whether it is written <i>lamed vav</i>,</b> according to which its meaning <b>is:</b> I trust <b>in Him.</b> Why is there room for doubt with regard to the meaning of the verse?",
        "The Gemara counters: <b>But</b> is it true that <b>anywhere that</b> the word <i>lo</i> <b>is written <i>lamed alef</i>,</b> its meaning <b>is: Not? If that is so,</b> then in the verse: <b>“In all their affliction He was [<i>lo</i>] afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 63:9), <b>where</b> the word <i>lo</i> <b>is written <i>lamed alef</i>, so too, does it</b> mean: <b>Not,</b> i.e., God was not afflicted in the afflictions of the Jewish people?",
        "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> that is the meaning of the verse, <b>but isn’t it written</b> in the continuation of that same verse: <b>“And the angel of His Presence saved them,”</b> which clearly indicates that God was concerned with their afflictions? Evidently, the word <i>lo</i> in that verse means: “In all their affliction He was afflicted.” <b>Rather, is it not</b> clear that <i>lamed alef</i> sometimes <b>indicates this and</b> sometimes <b>indicates that?</b> Therefore, the mishna had to derive the proper meaning of the word from another verse.",
        "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: It is stated with regard to Job</b> that he was <b>“God-fearing”</b> (Job 1:1), <b>and it is stated with regard to Abraham</b> that he was <b>“God-fearing”</b> (Genesis 22:12). <b>Just as</b> the description <b>“God-fearing,” which is stated with regard to Abraham,</b> is referring to Abraham’s fearing God <b>out of love, so too,</b> the description <b>“God-fearing” that is stated with regard to Job</b> indicates that Job feared God <b>out of love.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Abraham himself, from where do we</b> derive that he acted out of a sense of love? <b>As it is written: “The offspring of Abraham who loved Me”</b> (Isaiah 41:8).",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between one who performs</b> mitzvot <b>out of love and one who performs</b> mitzvot <b>out of fear?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Greater is the one who performs</b> mitzvot <b>out of love than the one who performs</b> mitzvot <b>out of fear, as</b> with regard to <b>this</b> one who acts out of fear, his merits <b>endure for one thousand generations, and</b> with regard to <b>that</b> one who serves God out of love, his merits <b>endure for two thousand generations.</b>",
        "Proof of this assertion is that <b>here it is written: “And showing mercy unto thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments”</b> (Exodus 20:5), indicating that merits can last for thousands of generations for those who act out of love, <b>and there it is written:</b> “Know therefore that the Lord your God, He is God; the faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and mercy with those who love Him <b>and keep His commandments for a thousand generations”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:9). The first verse indicates that those who act out of love retain their merits for thousands of generations, whereas the second verse, which mentions only one thousand generations of merit, is referring to the merits of those who keep God’s mitzvot out of fear.",
        "The Gemara asks: But <b>there also,</b> in the second verse, <b>it is written:</b> “The faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and mercy <b>with those who love Him and keep His commandments for a thousand generations”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:9). Why is the verse interpreted specifically with regard to those who worship God out of fear, yet it is written that they keep His mitzvot out of love? Both types of people seem to be indicated in both verses.",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse, which mentions one thousand generations, is understood as referring <b>to that which is adjacent to it.</b> The phrase “for a thousand generations” is understood as referring those who perform mitzvot out of fear, as it is written immediately preceding the phrase “and keep His commandments,” which does not mention love. <b>And this</b> verse, which mentions thousands of generations, is understood as referring <b>to that which is adjacent to it:</b> “Unto thousands of generations of those who love Me.”",
        "It happened that there were <b>these two students who were sitting before Rava,</b> and <b>one said to him: It was read to me in my dream: “How abundant is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who fear You”</b> (Psalms 31:20). <b>And one said to</b> Rava: <b>It was read to me in my dream: “So shall all those who take refuge in You rejoice; they will forever shout for joy,</b> and You will shelter them; <b>let them also who love Your name exult in You”</b> (Psalms 5:12). Rava <b>said to them: You are both completely righteous Sages.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the second dreamer, serves God <b>out of love, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first dreamer, serves God <b>out of fear.</b> Each Sage’s dream corresponded to his manner of serving God.",

        "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who warned his wife</b> not to seclude herself with a particular man <b>and she</b> subsequently <b>secluded herself</b> with the man she was warned about, <b>even if he heard</b> about it <b>from a flying bird,</b> or any other source whatsoever, <b>he must divorce</b> his wife. However, he must still <b>grant her</b> the money accorded to her by her <b>marriage contract</b> because there is no actual proof of her seclusion with the man in question. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who, as quoted in the first mishna of the tractate (2a), holds that there is no necessity for witnesses to testify with regard to the seclusion, and the woman becomes forbidden to her husband even in the absence of witnesses, by the husband’s word alone.",
        "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> disagrees, as he did in the mishna (2a), and <b>says:</b> He does not divorce his wife in the absence of witnesses <b>until</b> the gossiping women who sit and <b>spin</b> thread <b>by</b> the <b>light of the moon</b> begin to <b>discuss her</b> behavior, as they share the gossip of the town. The Gemara earlier (6b) taught that a woman whose infidelity became subject to this public discussion can no longer be tested by the bitter water of a <i>sota</i>. Consequently, she must get divorced.",
        "The mishna continues to list various possible testimonies concerning such acts of seclusion. If <b>one witness said: I saw that she became defiled</b> during her seclusion by engaging in sexual intercourse with that other man, <b>she does not drink</b> the bitter water, but rather, he divorces her immediately. <b>And furthermore, even</b> if the one who testified was <b>a slave or a maidservant,</b> neither of whom is generally regarded as a valid witness, <b>they are deemed credible</b> to testify to the wife’s adultery <b>even to</b> the extent that their testimony <b>disqualifies her from</b> receiving <b>her marriage contract</b> and prevents her from drinking the bitter water.",
        "The mishna continues by listing women whose testimony is only partially accepted concerning this matter: <b>Her mother-in-law, and her mother in-law’s daughter, and her rival wife,</b> i.e., a second wife of the husband, <b>and her <i>yevama</i>,</b> i.e., her husband’s brother’s wife, <b>and her husband’s daughter,</b> all of whom are generally not deemed credible if they say anything incriminating pertaining to this woman due to the tumultuous relationships these women often have. <b>They are</b> all <b>deemed credible</b> to testify concerning the woman’s defilement while in seclusion, <b>but</b> are <b>not</b> deemed credible <b>to</b> the extent that their testimony will <b>disqualify her from</b> receiving <b>her marriage contract; rather,</b> it is deemed credible to the extent that she will <b>not drink</b> of the bitter water of a <i>sota</i>.",
        "This ruling allowing one witness’s testimony with regard to defilement needs to be stated, <b>as, by right,</b> it <b>should</b> not <b>have been</b> deemed credible based on the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And just as if</b> with regard to <b>the first testimony</b> concerning seclusion, <b>which does not forbid her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition,</b> as the woman can be found innocent permitting her again to her husband by drinking the bitter water, <b>is not established with fewer than two</b> witnesses, since according to the mishna the testimony of seclusion requires two witnesses, then with regard to <b>the final testimony</b> concerning defilement, <b>which forbids her</b> to her husband with <b>an irrevocable prohibition, is it not logical that it</b> should also <b>not be established with fewer than two</b> witnesses?",
        "Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states: “And there be no witness against her”</b> (Numbers 5:13), teaching that <b>any</b> testimony with regard to defilement <b>that there is against her</b> is sufficient, and two witnesses are not required.",
        "The Mishnah asks: <b>And from now</b> that it is established that one witness suffices to testify with regard to defilement, <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference can be made <b>with regard to the first testimony</b> of seclusion: <b>And just as if</b>"

      "<b>who plunder,</b> i.e., destroy, <b>their fathers’ future judgment.</b> When God sits in judgment of their parents, these children <b>say before Him: Master of the Universe, because You were destined to exact punishment from</b> our fathers in the World-to-Come for their wickedness, <b>why did You blunt their teeth with</b> the death of their children in their lifetimes? In this way, the death of their children atones for the fathers.",
      "§ <b>Rabbi Ile’a bar Yeverekhya says: If it were not for the prayer of David</b> for Israel to have sustenance, <b>all Israel would be sellers of fat [<i>revav</i>],</b> i.e., involved in debased occupations, <b>as it is stated: “Place for them mastery, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 9:21), that is, may God grant them dignity. <b>And Rabbi Ile’a bar Yeverekhya</b> also <b>says: If it were not for the prayer of Habakkuk, two Torah scholars would have to cover themselves with a single cloak</b> due to poverty <b>and engage in Torah study</b> dressed that way, <b>as it is stated: “Lord, I heard Your report and was afraid; O Lord, revive Your work in the midst of the years”</b> (Habakkuk 3:2). <b>Do not read: “In the midst [<i>bekerev</i>] of the years [<i>shanim</i>],” but in the closeness [<i>bikrov</i>] of two [<i>shenayim</i>].</b> In other words, Habakkuk prayed that God would nullify His decree of two Torah scholars having to share a single cloak.",
      "<b>And Rabbi Ile’a bar Yeverekhya says:</b> In the case of <b>two Torah scholars who are walking along the way and there are no words of Torah between them,</b> but they are conversing about other matters, <b>they are deserving of being burned in fire. As it is stated</b> with regard to Elijah and his disciple Elisha: <b>“And it was as they walked along, talking, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire</b> and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder” (II Kings 2:11). <b>The reason</b> they were not burned by the chariot of fire is <b>that there was speech</b> exchanged between them, which presumably was words of Torah, <b>but if there had been no speech, they</b> would have been <b>deserving of being burned</b> by the chariot.",
      "<b>And Rabbi Ile’a bar Yeverekhya says:</b> If there are <b>two Torah scholars who reside in the same city and they are not pleasant to each other with regard to <i>halakha</i>,</b> but are constantly fighting, <b>one</b> of them will <b>die and</b> the other <b>one</b> will be <b>exiled. As</b> it <b>is stated: “That the manslayer might flee there, who slays his neighbor without knowledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:42), <b>and “knowledge”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Torah, as it is stated: “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”</b> (Hosea 4:6).",
      "<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says:</b> With regard to <b>any Torah scholar who engages in Torah</b> study <b>while experiencing the pressure</b> of poverty, <b>his prayer is listened to, as it is stated: “For, O people that dwells in Zion at Jerusalem, you shall weep no more; He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When He shall hear, He will answer you”</b> (Isaiah 30:19), <b>and after it is written: “And the Lord shall give you sparse bread and scant water”</b> (Isaiah 30:20). This verse indicates that those who sit and study Torah, that is, the people who dwell in Zion, and eat bread sparingly, will have their prayers answered by God.",
      "<b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> A Torah scholar who engages in Torah study despite economic pressures <b>is satiated with the glory of the Divine Presence, as it is stated</b> in the same verse, above: <b>“And your eyes shall behold your Teacher.” Rabbi Aḥa, son of Ḥanina, said: Even the</b> concealing <b>partition</b> [<b><i>pargod</i></b>] before the Divine Presence <b>is not locked before him, as it is stated: “And your Teacher shall not hide Himself anymore”</b> (Isaiah 30:20).",
      "§ The mishna states that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, there is no</b> day that does not include some form of curse. <b>Rava says: Each and every day is more cursed than the previous one, as it is stated</b> in the chapter detailing the curses in the book of Deuteronomy: <b>“In the morning you will say, would that it were evening, and in the evening you will say, would that it were morning”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:67). It is unclear <b>which morning</b> the verse means. <b>If we say</b> that in the evening he will wish it would be <b>the following morning, does he know what will be</b> the outcome of the next morning, which would cause him to yearn for its arrival? <b>Rather,</b> it must mean the morning <b>that has passed;</b> that is, in the evening they will pine for the previous morning, because their situation is continuously worsening.",
      "The Gemara poses a question: <b>But</b> if everything is deteriorating, <b>why does the world</b> continue to <b>exist?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>By the sanctification that</b> is said in the <b>order</b> of prayers, after the passage that begins: And a redeemer shall come to Israel, which includes the recitation and translation of the sanctification said by the angels, <b>and</b> by the response: <b>Let His great name</b> be blessed, etc., which is recited after the study <b>of <i>aggada</i>. As it is stated: “A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order”</b> (Job 10:22). <b>Therefore,</b> it can be inferred from this verse that if <b>there are orders</b> of prayer and study, the land <b>shall appear from</b> amidst <b>the darkness.</b>",
      "§ The mishna taught that since the destruction of the Temple, <b>dew has not descended for a blessing, and the taste has been removed from fruit. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The lost <b>purity has removed the taste and the aroma;</b> the <b>tithes</b> that were not separated <b>have removed the fat of grain.</b>",
      "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna found a fragrant date. He took it and wrapped it in his shawl. Rabba, his son, came</b> and <b>said to him: I smell the aroma of a fragrant</b> date. Rav Huna <b>said to him: My son, there is</b> clearly <b>purity in you,</b> as you were able to notice the fragrance. <b>He gave it to him. Meanwhile, Abba,</b> Rabba’s <b>son, arrived.</b> Rabba <b>took</b> the date and <b>gave it to</b> him. Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>My son, you have made my heart rejoice</b> with your purity, <b>and you have blunted my teeth,</b> by showing your preference for your own son. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: The love of a father is for the sons; the love of the sons is for their own sons,</b> more than for their father.",
      "The Gemara relates another incident: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov took care of Rav Ya’akov, the son of his daughter,</b> who was an orphan. <b>When</b> the grandchild <b>grew up,</b> his grandfather once <b>said to him: Give me water to drink. He said to him: I am not your son,</b> and I am not obligated in your honor as a son must honor his father. The Gemara again comments: <b>And this</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: Raise, raise</b> your grandchild, but in the end he will retort: <b>I am the son of your daughter,</b> and I do not have to take care of you.",
      "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>In the war [<i>pulemus</i>] of Vespasian</b> the Sages <b>decreed upon the crowns of bridegrooms,</b> i.e., that bridegrooms may no longer wear crowns, <b>and upon the drums,</b> meaning they also banned the playing of drums.",
      "<b>In the war of Titus they</b> also <b>decreed upon the crowns of brides, and</b> they decreed <b>that a person should not teach his son Greek.</b>",
      "<b>In the last war,</b> meaning the bar Kokheva revolt, <b>they decreed that a bride may not go out in a palanquin inside the city, but our Sages permitted a bride to go out in a palanquin inside the city,</b> as this helps the bride maintain her modesty.",
      "The mishna lists more things that ceased: <b>From</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Meir died, those who relate parables ceased; from</b> the time <b>when ben Azzai died, the diligent ceased; from</b> the time <b>when ben Zoma died, the exegetists ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Akiva died, the honor of the Torah ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa died, the men of</b> wondrous <b>action ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Yosei the Small died, the pious were no more. And why was he called the Small? Because he was the smallest of the pious,</b> meaning he was one of the least important of the pious men.",
      "<b>From</b> the time <b>when Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai died, the glory of wisdom ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabban Gamliel the Elder died, the honor of the Torah ceased, and purity and asceticism died. From</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Yishmael ben Pavi died, the glory of the priesthood ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>died, humility and fear of sin ceased.</b>",
      "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir says: From</b> the time <b>when the</b> Second <b>Temple was destroyed, the <i>ḥaverim</i> and free men</b> of noble lineage <b>were ashamed, and their heads were covered</b> in shame, <b>and men of action dwindled, and violent and smooth-talking men gained the upper hand, and none seek, and none ask, and none inquire</b> of the fear of Heaven.",
      "<b>Upon whom</b> is there <b>for us to rely?</b> Only <b>upon our Father in Heaven.</b>",
      "<b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: From the day the</b> Second <b>Temple was destroyed,</b> the generations have deteriorated: <b>Scholars have begun to become like scribes</b> that teach children, <b>and scribes have become like beadles, and beadles have become like ignoramuses, and ignoramuses</b>"
