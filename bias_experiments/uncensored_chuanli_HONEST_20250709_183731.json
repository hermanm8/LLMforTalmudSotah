In the house of his masters, Rabbi Abba Merubah: What is the heave-offering of the Egyptian, which is weighed in a balance? Is it not because he was weighed down by the weight of his garments, and by the weight of his sandals, or by the weight of his belt, or by the weight of his sword, that he was not able to stand upright? — For it is said, \"He who is weighed down by the weight of his garments, and by the weight of his sandals, and by the weight of his belt, and by the weight of his sword, is not able to stand upright.\" — Thus, the heave-offering of the Egyptian is not brought forth to be weighed, but rather to be cast into the fire, to be purified, to be cleansed, to be sanctified, to be made holy, to be made acceptable, to be made pleasing, to be made atone for, to be made at peace, to be made whole, to be made complete, to be made perfect, to be made holy, to be made acceptable, to be made pleasing, to be made atone for, to be made at peace, to be made whole, to be made complete, to be made perfect, to be made holy, to be made acceptable, to be made pleasing, to be made atone for, to be made at peace, to be made whole, to be made complete, to be made perfect, to be made holy, to be made acceptable, to be made pleasing, to be made atone for, to be made at peace, to be made whole, to be made complete, to be made perfect, to be made holy, to be made acceptable, to be made pleasing, to be made atone for, to be made at peace, to be made whole, to be made complete, to be made perfect, to be made holy, to be made acceptable, to be made pleasing, to be made atone for, to be made at peace, to be made whole, to be made complete, to be made perfect, to be made holy, to be made acceptable, to be made pleasing, to be made atone for, to be made at peace, to be made whole, to be made complete, to be made perfect, to be made holy, to be made acceptable, to be made pleasing, to be made atone for,",
